It was a big, bay-windowed house that seemed to Grant both luxurious and disorderly, with rugs crooked on the floors and cup rings bitten into the table varnish. Her mother was Icelandic\u2014a powerful woman with a froth of white hair and indignant far-left politics. The father was an important cardiologist, revered around the hospital but happily subservient at home, where he would listen to his wife\u2019s strange tirades with an absent-minded smile. Fiona had her own little car and a pile of cashmere sweaters, but she wasn\u2019t in a sorority, and her mother\u2019s political activity was probably the reason. Not that she cared. Sororities were a joke to her, and so was politics\u2014though she liked to play \u201cThe Four Insurgent Generals\u201d on the phonograph, and sometimes also the \u201cInternationale,\u201d very loud, if there was a guest she thought she could make nervous. A curly-haired gloomy-looking foreigner was courting her\u2014she said he was a Visigoth\u2014and so were two or three quite respectable and uneasy young interns. She made fun of them all and of Grant as well. She would drolly repeat some of his small-town phrases. He thought maybe she was joking when she proposed to him, on a cold bright day on the beach at Port Stanley. Sand was stinging their faces and the waves delivered crashing loads of gravel at their feet.\n\n\u201cDo you think it would be fun\u2014\u201d Fiona shouted. \u201cDo you think it would be fun if we got married?\u201d\n\nHe took her up on it, he shouted yes. He wanted never to be away from her. She had the spark of life.\n\n* * *\n\nJust before they left their house Fiona noticed a mark on the kitchen floor. It came from the cheap black house shoes she had been wearing earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cI thought they\u2019d quit doing that,\u201d she said in a tone of ordinary annoyance and perplexity, rubbing at the gray smear that looked as if it had been made by a greasy crayon.\n\nShe remarked that she\u2019d never have to do this again, since she wasn\u2019t taking those shoes with her.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be dressed up all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cOr semi-dressed up. It\u2019ll be sort of like in a hotel.\u201d\n\nShe rinsed out the rag she\u2019d been using and hung it on the rack inside the door under the sink. Then she put on her golden-brown, fur-collared ski jacket, over a white turtleneck sweater and tailored fawn slacks. She was a tall, narrow-shouldered woman, seventy years old but still upright and trim, with long legs and long feet, delicate wrists and ankles, and tiny, almost comical-looking ears. Her hair that was as light as milkweed fluff had gone from pale blond to white somehow without Grant\u2019s noticing exactly when, and she still wore it down to her shoulders, as her mother had done. (That was the thing that had alarmed Grant\u2019s own mother, a small-town widow who worked as a doctor\u2019s receptionist. The long white hair on Fiona\u2019s mother, even more than the state of the house, had told her all she needed to know about attitudes and politics.) But otherwise Fiona, with her fine bones and small sapphire eyes, was nothing like her mother. She had a slightly crooked mouth, which she emphasized now with red lipstick\u2014usually the last thing she did before she left the house.\n\nShe looked just like herself on this day\u2014direct and vague as in fact she was, sweet and ironic.\n\n* * *\n\nOver a year ago, Grant had started noticing so many little yellow notes stuck up all over the house. That was not entirely new. Fiona had always written things down\u2014the title of a book she\u2019d heard mentioned on the radio or the jobs she wanted to make sure she got done that day. Even her morning schedule was written down. He found it mystifying and touching in its precision: \u201c7 a.m. yoga. 7:30\u20137:45 teeth face hair. 7:45\u2013 8:15 walk. 8:15 Grant and breakfast.\u201d\n\nThe new notes were different. Stuck onto the kitchen drawers\u2014Cutlery, Dishtowels, Knives. Couldn\u2019t she just open the drawers and see what was inside?\nWorse things were coming. She went to town and phoned Grant from a booth to ask him how to drive home. She went for her usual walk across the field into the woods and came home by the fence line\u2014a very long way round. She said that she\u2019d counted on fences always taking you somewhere.\n\nIt was hard to figure out. She\u2019d said that about fences as if it were a joke, and she had remembered the phone number without any trouble.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to worry about,\u201d she said. \u201cI expect I\u2019m just losing my mind.\u201d\n\nHe asked if she had been taking sleeping pills.\n\n\u201cIf I am I don\u2019t remember,\u201d she said. Then she said she was sorry to sound so flippant. \u201cI\u2019m sure I haven\u2019t been taking anything. Maybe I should be. Maybe vitamins.\u201d\n\nVitamins didn\u2019t help. She would stand in doorways trying to figure out where she was going. She forgot to turn on the burner under the vegetables or put water in the coffeemaker. She asked Grant when they\u2019d moved to this house.\n\n\u201cWas it last year or the year before?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was twelve years ago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s shocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always been a bit like this,\u201d Grant said to the doctor. He tried without success to explain how Fiona\u2019s surprise and apologies now seemed somehow like routine courtesy, not quite concealing a private amusement. As if she\u2019d stumbled on some unexpected adventure. Or begun playing a game that she hoped he would catch on to.\n\n\u201cYes, well,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cIt might be selective at first. We don\u2019t know, do we? Till we see the pattern of the deterioration, we really can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nIn a while it hardly mattered what label was put on it. Fiona, who no longer went shopping alone, disappeared from the supermarket while Grant had his back turned. A policeman picked her up as she was walking down the middle of the road, blocks away. He asked her name and she answered readily. Then he asked her the name of the Prime Minister.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know that, young man, you really shouldn\u2019t be in such a responsible job.\u201d\nHe laughed. But then she made the mistake of asking if he\u2019d seen Boris and Natasha. These were the now dead Russian wolfhounds she had adopted many years ago, as a favor to a friend, then devoted herself to for the rest of their lives. Her taking them over might have coincided with the discovery that she was not likely to have children. Something about her tubes being blocked, or twisted\u2014Grant could not remember now. He had always avoided thinking about all that female apparatus. Or it might have been after her mother died. The dogs\u2019 long legs and silky hair, their narrow, gentle, intransigent faces made a fine match for her when she took them out for walks. And Grant himself, in those days, landing his first job at the university (his father-in-law\u2019s money welcome there in spite of the political taint), might have seemed to some people to have been picked up on another of Fiona\u2019s eccentric whims, and groomed and tended and favored\u2014though, fortunately, he didn\u2019t understand this until much later.\n\n* * *\n\nThere was a rule that nobody could be admitted to Meadowlake during the month of December. The holiday season had so many emotional pitfalls. So they made the twenty-minute drive in January. Before they reached the highway the country road dipped through a swampy hollow now completely frozen over.\n\nFiona said, \u201cOh, remember.\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cI was thinking about that, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly it was in the moonlight,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was talking about the time that they had gone out skiing at night under the full moon and over the black-striped snow, in this place that you could get into only in the depths of winter. They had heard the branches cracking in the cold.\n\nIf she could remember that, so vividly and correctly, could there really be so much the matter with her? It was all he could do not to turn around and drive home.\n\nThere was another rule that the supervisor explained to him. New residents were not to be visited during the first thirty days. Most people needed that time to get settled in. Before the rule had been put in place, there had been pleas and tears and tantrums, even from those who had come in willingly. Around the third or fourth day they would start lamenting and begging to be taken home. And some relatives could be susceptible to that, so you would have people being carted home who would not get on there any better than they had before. Six months or sometimes only a few weeks later, the whole upsetting hassle would have to be gone through again.\n\n\u201cWhereas we find,\u201d the supervisor said, \u201cwe find that if they\u2019re left on their own the first month they usually end up happy as clams.\u201d\n\nThey had in fact gone over to Meadowlake a few times several years ago to visit Mr. Farquhar, the old bachelor farmer who had been their neighbor. He had lived by himself in a drafty brick house unaltered since the early years of the century, except for the addition of a refrigerator and a television set. Now, just as Mr. Farquhar\u2019s house was gone, replaced by a gimcrack sort of castle that was the weekend home of some people from Toronto, the old Meadowlake was gone, though it had dated only from the fifties. The new building was a spacious, vaulted place, whose air was faintly, pleasantly pine-scented. Profuse and genuine greenery sprouted out of giant crocks in the hallways.\n\nNevertheless, it was the old Meadowlake that Grant found himself picturing Fiona in, during the long month he had to get through without seeing her. He phoned every day and hoped to get the nurse whose name was Kristy. She seemed a little amused at his constancy, but she would give him a fuller report than any other nurse he got stuck with.\n\nFiona had caught a cold the first week, she said, but that was not unusual for newcomers. \u201cLike when your kids start school,\u201d Kristy said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of new germs they\u2019re exposed to and for a while they just catch everything.\u201d\nThen the cold got better. She was off the antibiotics and she didn\u2019t seem as confused as she had been when she came in. (This was the first Grant had heard about either the antibiotics or the confusion.) Her appetite was pretty good and she seemed to enjoy sitting in the sunroom. And she was making some friends, Kristy said.\n\nIf anybody phoned, he let the machine pick up. The people they saw socially, occasionally, were not close neighbors but people who lived around the country, who were retired, as they were, and who often went away without notice. They would imagine that he and Fiona were away on some such trip at present.\n\nGrant skied for exercise. He skied around and around in the field behind the house as the sun went down and left the sky pink over a countryside that seemed to be bound by waves of blue-edged ice. Then he came back to the darkening house, turning the television news on while he made his supper. They had usually prepared supper together. One of them made the drinks and the other the fire, and they talked about his work (he was writing a study of legendary Norse wolves and particularly of the great wolf Fenrir, which swallows up Odin at the end of the world) and about whatever Fiona was reading and what they had been thinking during their close but separate day. This was their time of liveliest intimacy, though there was also, of course, the five or ten minutes of physical sweetness just after they got into bed\u2014 something that did not often end in sex but reassured them that sex was not over yet.\n\n* * *\n\nIn a dream he showed a letter to one of his colleagues. The letter was from the roommate of a girl he had not thought of for a while and was sanctimonious and hostile, threatening in a whining way. The girl herself was someone he had parted from decently and it seemed unlikely that she would want to make a fuss, let alone try to kill herself, which was what the letter was elaborately trying to tell him she had done.\n\nHe had thought of the colleague as a friend. He was one of those husbands who had been among the first to throw away their neckties and leave home to spend every night on a floor mattress with a bewitching young mistress\u2014coming to their offices, their classes, bedraggled and smelling of dope and incense. But now he took a dim view.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t laugh,\u201d he said to Grant\u2014who did not think he had been laughing. \u201cAnd if I were you I\u2019d try to prepare Fiona.\u201d\n\nSo Grant went off to find Fiona in Meadowlake\u2014the old Meadowlake\u2014and got into a lecture hall instead. Everybody was waiting there for him to teach his class. And sitting in the last, highest row was a flock of cold-eyed young women all in black robes, all in mourning, who never took their bitter stares off him, and pointedly did not write down, or care about, anything he was saying.\n\nFiona was in the first row, untroubled. \u201cOh phooey,\u201d she said. \u201cGirls that age are always going around talking about how they\u2019ll kill themselves.\u201d\n\nHe hauled himself out of the dream, took pills, and set about separating what was real from what was not.\n\nThere had been a letter, and the word \u201crat\u201d had appeared in black paint on his office door, and Fiona, on being told that a girl had suffered from a bad crush on him, had said pretty much what she said in the dream. The colleague hadn\u2019t come into it, and nobody had committed suicide. Grant hadn\u2019t been disgraced. In fact, he had got off easy when you thought of what might have happened just a couple of years later. But word got around. Cold shoulders became conspicuous. They had few Christmas invitations and spent New Year\u2019s Eve alone. Grant got drunk, and without its being required of him\u2014also, thank God, without making the error of a confession\u2014he promised Fiona a new life.\n\nNowhere had there been any acknowledgment that the life of a philanderer (if that was what Grant had to call himself\u2014he who had not had half as many conquests as the man who had reproached him in his dream) involved acts of generosity, and even sacrifice. Many times he had catered to a woman\u2019s pride, to her fragility, by offering more affection\u2014or a rougher passion\u2014than anything he really felt. All so that he could now find himself accused of wounding and exploiting and destroying self-esteem. And of deceiving Fiona\u2014as, of course, he had. But would it have been better if he had done as others had done with their wives, and left her? He had never thought of such a thing. He had never stopped making love to Fiona. He had not stayed away from her for a single night. No making up elaborate stories in order to spend a weekend in San Francisco or in a tent on Manitoulin Island. He had gone easy on the dope and the drink, and he had continued to publish papers, serve on committees, make progress in his career. He had never had any intention of throwing over work and marriage and taking to the country to practice carpentry or keep bees.\n\nBut something like that had happened, after all. He had taken early retirement with a reduced pension. Fiona\u2019s father had died, after some bewildered and stoical time alone in the big house, and Fiona had inherited both that property and the farmhouse where her father had grown up, in the country near Georgian Bay.\n\nIt was a new life. He and Fiona worked on the house. They got cross-country skis. They were not very sociable but they gradually made some friends. There were no more hectic flirtations. No bare female toes creeping up under a man\u2019s pants leg at a dinner party. No more loose wives.\n\nJust in time, Grant was able to think, when the sense of injustice had worn down. The feminists and perhaps the sad silly girl herself and his cowardly so-called friends had pushed him out just in time. Out of a life that was in fact getting to be more trouble than it was worth. And that might eventually have cost him Fiona.\n\n* * *\n\nOn the morning of the day when he was to go back to Meadowlake, for the first visit, Grant woke early. He was full of a solemn tingling, as in the old days on the morning of his first planned meeting with a new woman. The feeling was not precisely sexual. (Later, when the meetings had become routine, that was all it was.) There was an expectation of discovery, almost a spiritual expansion. Also timidity, humility, alarm.\n\nThere had been a thaw. Plenty of snow was left, but the dazzling hard landscape of earlier winter had crumbled. These pocked heaps under a gray sky looked like refuse in the fields. In the town near Meadowlake he found a florist\u2019s shop and bought a large bouquet. He had never presented flowers to Fiona before. Or to anyone else. He entered the building feeling like a hopeless lover or a guilty husband in a cartoon.\n\n\u201cWow. Narcissus this early,\u201d Kristy said. \u201cYou must\u2019ve spent a fortune.\u201d She went along the hall ahead of him and snapped on the light in a sort of pantry, where she searched for a vase. She was a heavy young woman who looked as if she had given up on her looks in every department except her hair. That was blond and voluminous. All the puffed-up luxury of a cocktail waitress\u2019s style, or a stripper\u2019s, on top of such a workaday face and body.\n\n\u201cThere now,\u201d she said, and nodded him down the hall. \u201cName\u2019s right on the door.\u201d\n\nSo it was, on a nameplate decorated with bluebirds. He wondered whether to knock, and did, then opened the door and called her name.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t there. The closet door was closed, the bed smoothed. Nothing on the bedside table, except a box of Kleenex and a glass of water. Not a single photograph or picture of any kind, not a book or a magazine. Perhaps you had to keep those in a cupboard.\n\nHe went back to the nurses\u2019 station. Kristy said, \u201cNo?\u201d with a surprise that he thought perfunctory. He hesitated, holding the flowers. She said, \u201cO.K., O.K.\u2014let\u2019s set the bouquet down here.\u201d Sighing, as if he were a backward child on his first day at school, she led him down the hall toward a large central space with skylights which seemed to be a general meeting area. Some people were sitting along the walls, in easy chairs, others at tables in the middle of the carpeted floor. None of them looked too bad. Old\u2014some of them incapacitated enough to need wheelchairs\u2014but decent. There had been some unnerving sights when he and Fiona visited Mr. Farquhar. Whiskers on old women\u2019s chins, somebody with a bulged-out eye like a rotted plum. Dribblers, head wagglers, mad chatterers. Now it looked as if there\u2019d been some weeding out of the worst cases.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d said Kristy in a softer voice. \u201cYou just go up and say hello and try not to startle her. Just go ahead.\u201d\n\nHe saw Fiona in profile, sitting close up to one of the card tables, but not playing. She looked a little puffy in the face, the flab on one cheek hiding the corner of her mouth, in a way it hadn\u2019t done before. She was watching the play of the man she sat closest to. He held his cards tilted so that she could see them. When Grant got near the table she looked up. They all looked up\u2014all the players at the table looked up, with displeasure. Then they immediately looked down at their cards, as if to ward off any intrusion.\n\nBut Fiona smiled her lopsided, abashed, sly, and charming smile and pushed back her chair and came round to him, putting her fingers to her mouth.\n\n\u201cBridge,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDeadly serious. They\u2019re quite rabid about it.\u201d She drew him toward the coffee table, chatting. \u201cI can remember being like that for a while at college. My friends and I would cut class and sit in the common room and smoke and play like cutthroats. Can I get you anything? A cup of tea? I\u2019m afraid the coffee isn\u2019t up to much here.\u201d\n\nGrant never drank tea.\n\nHe could not throw his arms around her. Something about her voice and smile, familiar as they were, something about the way she seemed to be guarding the players from him\u2014as well as him from their displeasure\u2014made that impossible.\n\n\u201cI brought you some flowers,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought they\u2019d do to brighten up your room. I went to your room but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She glanced back at the table.\n\nGrant said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made a new friend.\u201d He nodded toward the man she\u2019d been sitting next to. At this moment that man looked up at Fiona and she turned, either because of what Grant had said or because she felt the look at her back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just Aubrey,\u201d she said. \u201cThe funny thing is I knew him years and years ago. He worked in the store. The hardware store where my grandpa used to shop. He and I were always kidding around and he couldn\u2019t get up the nerve to ask me out. Till the very last weekend and he took me to a ballgame. But when it was over my grandpa showed up to drive me home. I was up visiting for the summer. Visiting my grandparents\u2014they lived on a farm.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiona. I know where your grandparents lived. It\u2019s where we live. Lived.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d she said, not paying her full attention because the cardplayer was sending her his look, which was one not of supplication but of command. He was a man of about Grant\u2019s age, or a little older. Thick coarse white hair fell over his forehead and his skin was leathery but pale, yellowish-white like an old wrinkled-up kid glove. His long face was dignified and melancholy and he had something of the beauty of a powerful, discouraged, elderly horse. But where Fiona was concerned he was not discouraged.\n\n\u201cI better go back,\u201d Fiona said, a blush spotting her newly fattened face. \u201cHe thinks he can\u2019t play without me sitting there. It\u2019s silly, I hardly know the game anymore. If I leave you now, you can entertain yourself? It must all seem strange to you but you\u2019ll be surprised how soon you get used to it. You\u2019ll get to know who everybody is. Except that some of them are pretty well off in the clouds, you know\u2014you can\u2019t expect them all to get to know who you are.\u201d\n\nShe slipped back into her chair and said something into Aubrey\u2019s ear. She tapped her fingers across the back of his hand.\n\nGrant went in search of Kristy and met her in the hall. She was pushing a cart with pitchers of apple juice and grape juice.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d she said.\n\nGrant said, \u201cDoes she even know who I am?\u201d He could not decide. She could have been playing a joke. It would not be unlike her. She had given herself away by that little pretense at the end, talking to him as if she thought perhaps he was a new resident. If it was a pretense.\n\nKristy said, \u201cYou just caught her at sort of a bad moment. Involved in the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not even playing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, but her friend\u2019s playing. Aubrey.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo who is Aubrey?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who he is. Aubrey. Her friend. Would you like a juice?\u201d\n\nGrant shook his head.\n\n\u201cOh look,\u201d said Kristy. \u201cThey get these attachments. That takes over for a while. Best buddy sort of thing. It\u2019s kind of a phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean she really might not know who I am?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might not. Not today. Then tomorrow\u2014you never know, do you? You\u2019ll see the way it is, once you\u2019ve been coming here for a while. You\u2019ll learn not to take it all so serious. Learn to take it day by day.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDay by day. But things really didn\u2019t change back and forth and he didn\u2019t get used to the way they were. Fiona was the one who seemed to get used to him, but only as some persistent visitor who took a special interest in her. Or perhaps even as a nuisance who must be prevented, according to her old rules of courtesy, from realizing that he was one. She treated him with a distracted, social sort of kindness that was successful in keeping him from asking the most obvious, the most necessary question: did she remember him as her husband of nearly fifty years? He got the impression that she would be embarrassed by such a question\u2014embarrassed not for herself but for him.\n\nKristy told him that Aubrey had been the local representative of a company that sold weed killer \u201cand all that kind of stuff\u201d to farmers. And then when he was not very old or even retired, she said, he had suffered some unusual kind of damage.\n\n\u201cHis wife is the one takes care of him, usually at home. She just put him in here on temporary care so she could get a break. Her sister wanted her to go to Florida. See, she\u2019s had a hard time, you wouldn\u2019t ever have expected a man like him\u2014they just went on a holiday somewhere and he got something, like some bug that gave him a terrible high fever? And it put him in a coma and left him like he is now.\u201d\n\nMost afternoons the pair could be found at the card table. Aubrey had large, thick-fingered hands. It was difficult for him to manage his cards. Fiona shuffled and dealt for him and sometimes moved quickly to straighten a card that seemed to be slipping from his grasp. Grant would watch from across the room her darting move and quick laughing apology. He could see Aubrey\u2019s husbandly frown as a wisp of her hair touched his cheek. Aubrey preferred to ignore her, as long as she stayed close.\n\nBut let her smile her greeting at Grant, let her push back her chair and get up to offer him tea\u2014showing that she had accepted his right to be there\u2014and Aubrey\u2019s face took on its look of sombre consternation. He would let the cards slide from his fingers and fall on the floor to spoil the game. And Fiona then had to get busy and put things right.\n\nIf Fiona and Aubrey weren\u2019t at the bridge table they might be walking along the halls, Aubrey hanging on to the railing with one hand and clutching Fiona\u2019s arm or shoulder with the other. The nurses thought that it was a marvel, the way she had got him out of his wheelchair. Though for longer trips\u2014to the conservatory at one end of the building or the television room at the other\u2014the wheelchair was called for.\n\nIn the conservatory, the pair would find themselves a seat among the most lush and thick and tropical-looking plants\u2014a bower, if you liked. Grant stood nearby, on occasion, on the other side of the greenery, listening. Mixed in with the rustle of the leaves and the sound of plashing water was Fiona\u2019s soft talk and her laughter. Then some sort of chortle. Aubrey could talk, though his voice probably didn\u2019t sound as it used to. He seemed to say something now\u2014a couple of thick syllables.\n\nTake care. He\u2019s here. My love.\n\nGrant made an effort, and cut his visits down to Wednesdays and Saturdays. Saturdays had a holiday bustle and tension. Families arrived in clusters. Mothers were usually in charge; they were the ones who kept the conversation afloat. Men seemed cowed, teen-agers affronted. No children or grandchildren appeared to visit Aubrey, and since they could not play cards\u2014the tables being taken over for ice-cream parties\u2014he and Fiona stayed clear of the Saturday parade. The conservatory was far too popular then for any of their intimate conversations. Those might be going on, of course, behind Fiona\u2019s closed door. Grant could not manage to knock when he found it closed, though he stood there for some time staring at the Disney-style nameplate with an intense, a truly malignant dislike.\n\nOr they might be in Aubrey\u2019s room. But he did not know where that was. The more he explored this place the more corridors and seating spaces and ramps he discovered, and in his wanderings he was still apt to get lost. One Saturday he looked out a window and saw Fiona\u2014it had to be her\u2014wheeling Aubrey along one of the paved paths now cleared of snow and ice. She was wearing a silly wool hat and a jacket with swirls of blue and purple, the sort of thing he had seen on local women at the supermarket. It must be that they didn\u2019t bother to sort out the wardrobes of the women who were roughly the same size and counted on the women not to recognize their own clothes anyway. They had cut her hair, too. They had cut away her angelic halo.\n\nOn a Wednesday, when everything was more normal and card games were going on again and the women in the Crafts Room were making silk flowers or costumed dolls\u2014and when Aubrey and Fiona were again in evidence, so that it was possible for Grant to have one of his brief and friendly and maddening conversations with his wife\u2014he said to her, \u201cWhy did they chop off your hair?\u201d\n\nFiona put her hands up to her head, to check.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2014I never missed it,\u201d she said.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen Grant had first started teaching Anglo-Saxon and Nordic literature he got the regular sort of students in his classes. But after a few years he noticed a change. Married women had started going back to school. Not with the idea of qualifying for a better job, or for any job, but simply to give themselves something more interesting to think about than their usual housework and hobbies. To enrich their lives. And perhaps it followed naturally that the men who taught them these things became part of the enrichment, that these men seemed to these women more mysterious and desirable than the men they still cooked for and slept with.\n\nThose who signed up for Grant\u2019s courses might have a Scandinavian background or they might have learned something about Norse mythology from Wagner or historical novels. There were also a few who thought he was teaching a Celtic language and for whom everything Celtic had a mystic allure. He spoke to such aspirants fairly roughly from his side of the desk.\n\n\u201cIf you want to learn a pretty language go and learn Spanish. Then you can use it if you go to Mexico.\u201d\n\nSome took his warning and drifted away. Others seemed to be moved in a personal way by his demanding tone. They worked with a will and brought into his office, into his regulated satisfactory life, the great surprising bloom of their mature female compliance, their tremulous hope of approval.\n\nHe chose a woman named Jacqui Adams. She was the opposite of Fiona\u2014short, cushiony, dark-eyed, effusive. A stranger to irony. The affair lasted for a year, until her husband was transferred. When they were saying goodbye in her car, she began to shake uncontrollably. It was as if she had hypothermia. She wrote to him a few times, but he found the tone of her letters overwrought and could not decide how to answer. He let the time for answering slip away while he became magically and unexpectedly involved with a girl who was young enough to be Jacqui\u2019s daughter.\n\nFor another and more dizzying development had taken place while he was busy with Jacqui. Young girls with long hair and sandalled feet were coming into his office and all but declaring themselves ready for sex. The cautious approaches, the tender intimations of feeling required with Jacqui were out the window. A whirlwind hit him, as it did many others. Scandals burst wide open, with high and painful drama all round but a feeling that somehow it was better so. There were reprisals; there were firings. But those fired went off to teach at smaller, more tolerant colleges or Open Learning Centers, and many wives left behind got over the shock and took up the costumes, the sexual nonchalance of the girls who had tempted their men. Academic parties, which used to be so predictable, became a minefield. An epidemic had broken out, it was spreading like the Spanish flu. Only this time people ran after contagion, and few between sixteen and sixty seemed willing to be left out.\n\nThat was exaggeration, of course. Fiona was quite willing. And Grant himself did not go overboard. What he felt was mainly a gigantic increase in well-being. A tendency to pudginess which he had had since he was twelve years old disappeared. He ran up steps two at a time. He appreciated as never before a pageant of torn clouds and winter sunsets seen from his office window, the charm of antique lamps glowing between his neighbors\u2019 living-room curtains, the cries of children in the park, at dusk, unwilling to leave the hill where they\u2019d been tobogganing. Come summer, he learned the names of flowers. In his classroom, after being coached by his nearly voiceless mother-in-law (her affliction was cancer in the throat), he risked reciting the majestic and gory Icelandic ode, the H\u00f6fudlausn, composed to honor King Erik Blood-axe by the skald whom that king had condemned to death.\n\nFiona had never learned Icelandic and she had never shown much respect for the stories that it preserved\u2014the stories that Grant had taught and written about. She referred to their heroes as \u201cold Njal\u201d or \u201cold Snorri.\u201d But in the last few years she had developed an interest in the country itself and looked at travel guides. She read about William Morris\u2019s trip, and Auden\u2019s. She didn\u2019t really plan to travel there. She said there ought to be one place you thought about and knew about and maybe longed for but never did get to see.\n\nNonetheless, the next time he went to Meadowlake, Grant brought Fiona a book he\u2019d found of nineteenth-century watercolors made by a lady traveller to Iceland. It was a Wednesday. He went looking for her at the card tables but didn\u2019t see her. A woman called out to him, \u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s sick.\u201d\n\nHer voice sounded self-important and excited\u2014pleased with herself for having recognized him when he knew nothing about her. Perhaps also pleased with all she knew about Fiona, about Fiona\u2019s life here, thinking it was maybe more than he knew.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not here, either,\u201d she added.\n\nGrant went to find Kristy, who didn\u2019t have much time for him. She was talking to a weepy woman who looked like a first-time visitor.\n\n\u201cNothing really,\u201d she said, when he asked what was the matter with Fiona. \u201cShe\u2019s just having a day in bed today, just a bit of an upset.\u201d\n\nFiona was sitting straight up in the bed. He hadn\u2019t noticed, the few times that he had been in this room, that this was a hospital bed and could be cranked up in such a way. She was wearing one of her high-necked maidenly gowns, and her face had a pallor that was like flour paste.\n\nAubrey was beside her in his wheelchair, pushed as close to the bed as he could get. Instead of the nondescript open-necked shirts he usually wore, he was wearing a jacket and tie. His natty-looking tweed hat was resting on the bed. He looked as if he had been out on important business.\n\nWhatever he\u2019d been doing, he looked worn out by it. He, too, was gray in the face.\n\nThey both looked up at Grant with a stony grief-ridden apprehension that turned to relief, if not to welcome, when they saw who he was. Not who they thought he\u2019d be. They were hanging on to each other\u2019s hands and they did not let go.\n\nThe hat on the bed. The jacket and tie.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Aubrey had been out. It wasn\u2019t a question of where he\u2019d been or whom he\u2019d been to see. It was where he was going.\n\nGrant set the book down on the bed beside Fiona\u2019s free hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Iceland,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d like to look at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d said Fiona. She didn\u2019t look at the book.\n\n\u201cIceland,\u201d he said.\n\nShe said, \u201cIce-land.\u201d The first syllable managed to hold a tinkle of interest, but the second fell flat. Anyway, it was necessary for her to turn her attention back to Aubrey, who was pulling his great thick hand out of hers.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is it, dear heart?\u201d\n\nGrant had never heard her use this flowery expression before.\n\n\u201cOh all right,\u201d she said. \u201cOh here.\u201d And she pulled a handful of tissues from the box beside her bed. Aubrey had begun to weep.\n\n\u201cHere. Here,\u201d she said, and he got hold of the Kleenex as well as he could and made a few awkward but lucky swipes at his face. While he was occupied, Fiona turned to Grant.\n\n\u201cDo you by any chance have any influence around here?\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you talking to them...\u201d\n\nAubrey made a noise of protest or weariness or disgust. Then his upper body pitched forward as if he wanted to throw himself against her. She scrambled half out of bed and caught him and held on to him. It seemed improper for Grant to help her.\n\n\u201cHush,\u201d Fiona was saying. \u201cOh, honey. Hush. We\u2019ll get to see each other. We\u2019ll have to. I\u2019ll go and see you. You\u2019ll come and see me.\u201d\n\nAubrey made the same sound again with his face in her chest and there was nothing Grant could decently do but get out of the room.\n\n\u201cI just wish his wife would hurry up and get here,\u201d Kristy said when he ran into her. \u201cI wish she\u2019d get him out of here and cut the agony short. We\u2019ve got to start serving supper before long and how are we supposed to get her to swallow anything with him still hanging around?\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cShould I stay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for? She\u2019s not sick, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo keep her company,\u201d he said.\n\nKristy shook her head.\n\n\u201cThey have to get over these things on their own. They\u2019ve got short memories, usually. That\u2019s not always so bad.\u201d\n\nGrant left without going back to Fiona\u2019s room. He noticed that the wind was actually warm and the crows were making an uproar. In the parking lot a woman wearing a tartan pants suit was getting a folded-up wheelchair out of the trunk of her car.\n\n* * *\n\nFiona did not get over her sorrow. She didn\u2019t eat at mealtimes, though she pretended to, hiding food in her napkin. She was being given a supplementary drink twice a day\u2014someone stayed and watched while she swallowed it down. She got out of bed and dressed herself, but all she wanted to do then was sit in her room. She wouldn\u2019t have had any exercise at all if Kristy, or Grant during visiting hours, hadn\u2019t walked her up and down in the corridors or taken her outside. Weeping had left her eyes raw-edged and dim. Her cardigan\u2014if it was hers\u2014would be buttoned crookedly. She had not got to the stage of leaving her hair unbrushed or her nails uncleaned, but that might come soon. Kristy said that her muscles were deteriorating, and that if she didn\u2019t improve they would put her on a walker.\n\n\u201cBut, you know, once they get a walker they start to depend on it and they never walk much anymore, just get wherever it is they have to go,\u201d she said to Grant. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to work at her harder. Try to encourage her.\u201d\n\nBut Grant had no luck at that. Fiona seemed to have taken a dislike to him, though she tried to cover it up. Perhaps she was reminded, every time she saw him, of her last minutes with Aubrey, when she had asked him for help and he hadn\u2019t helped her.\n\nHe didn\u2019t see much point in mentioning their marriage now.\n\nThe supervisor called him in to her office. She said that Fiona\u2019s weight was going down even with the supplement.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019m sure you know, we don\u2019t do any prolonged bed care on the first floor. We do it temporarily if someone isn\u2019t feeling well, but if they get too weak to move around and be responsible we have to consider upstairs.\u201d\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t think that Fiona had been in bed that often.\n\n\u201cNo. But if she can\u2019t keep up her strength she will be. Right now she\u2019s borderline.\u201d\n\nGrant said that he had thought the second floor was for people whose minds were disturbed.\n\n\u201cThat, too,\u201d she said.\n\n* * *\n\nThe street Grant found himself driving down was called Blackhawks Lane. The houses all looked to have been built around the same time, perhaps thirty or forty years ago. The street was wide and curving and there were no sidewalks. Friends of Grant and Fiona\u2019s had moved to places something like this when they began to have their children, and young families still lived here. There were basketball hoops over garage doors and tricycles in the driveways. Some of the houses had gone downhill. The yards were marked by tire tracks, the windows plastered with tinfoil or hung with faded flags. But a few seemed to have been kept up as well as possible by the people who had moved into them when they were new\u2014people who hadn\u2019t had the money or perhaps hadn\u2019t felt the need to move on to some place better.\n\nThe house that was listed in the phone book as belonging to Aubrey and his wife was one of these. The front walk was paved with flagstones and bordered by hyacinths that stood as stiff as china flowers, alternately pink and blue.\n\nHe hadn\u2019t remembered anything about Aubrey\u2019s wife except the tartan suit he had seen her wearing in the parking lot. The tails of the jacket had flared open as she bent into the trunk of the car. He had got the impression of a trim waist and wide buttocks.\n\nShe was not wearing the tartan suit today. Brown belted slacks and a pink sweater. He was right about the waist\u2014the tight belt showed she made a point of it. It might have been better if she didn\u2019t, since she bulged out considerably above and below.\n\nShe could be ten or twelve years younger than her husband. Her hair was short, curly, artificially reddened. She had blue eyes\u2014a lighter blue than Fiona\u2019s\u2014a flat robin\u2019s-egg or turquoise blue, slanted by a slight puffiness. And a good many wrinkles, made more noticeable by a walnut-stain makeup. Or perhaps that was her Florida tan.\n\nHe said that he didn\u2019t quite know how to introduce himself.\n\n\u201cI used to see your husband at Meadowlake. I\u2019m a regular visitor there myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Aubrey\u2019s wife, with an aggressive movement of her chin.\n\n\u201cHow is your husband doing?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cdoing\u201d was added on at the last moment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy wife and he struck up quite a close friendship.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to talk to you about something if you had a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband did not try to start anything with your wife if that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting at,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did not molest her. He isn\u2019t capable of it and he wouldn\u2019t anyway. From what I heard it was the other way round.\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cNo. That isn\u2019t it at all. I didn\u2019t come here with any complaints about anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I thought you did. You better come in then. It\u2019s blowing cold in through the door. It\u2019s not as warm out today as it looks.\u201d\n\nSo it was something of a victory for him even to get inside.\n\nShe took him past the living room, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to sit in the kitchen, where I can hear Aubrey.\u201d\n\nGrant caught sight of two layers of front-window curtains, both blue, one sheer and one silky, a matching blue sofa and a daunting pale carpet, various bright mirrors and ornaments. Fiona had a word for those sort of swooping curtains\u2014she said it like a joke, though the women she\u2019d picked it up from used it seriously. Any room that Fiona fixed up was bare and bright. She would have deplored the crowding of all this fancy stuff into such a small space. From a room off the kitchen\u2014a sort of sunroom, though the blinds were drawn against the afternoon brightness\u2014he could hear the sounds of television.\n\nThe answer to Fiona\u2019s prayers sat a few feet away, watching what sounded like a ballgame. His wife looked in at him.\n\nShe said, \u201cYou O.K.?\u201d and partly closed the door.\n\n\u201cYou might as well have a cup of coffee,\u201d she said to Grant. \u201cMy son got him on the sports channel a year ago Christmas. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d do without it.\u201d\n\nOn the kitchen counters there were all sorts of contrivances and appliances\u2014coffeemaker, food processor, knife sharpener, and some things Grant didn\u2019t know the names or uses of. All looked new and expensive, as if they had just been taken out of their wrappings, or were polished daily.\n\nHe thought it might be a good idea to admire things. He admired the coffeemaker she was using and said that he and Fiona had always meant to get one. This was absolutely untrue\u2014Fiona had been devoted to a European contraption that made only two cups at a time.\n\n\u201cThey gave us that,\u201d she said. \u201cOur son and his wife. They live in Kamloops. B.C. They send us more stuff than we can handle. It wouldn\u2019t hurt if they would spend the money to come and see us instead.\u201d\n\nGrant said philosophically, \u201cI suppose they\u2019re busy with their own lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t too busy to go to Hawaii last winter. You could understand it if we had somebody else in the family, closer at hand. But he\u2019s the only one.\u201d\n\nShe poured the coffee into two brown-and-green ceramic mugs that she took from the amputated branches of a ceramic tree trunk that sat on the table.\n\n\u201cPeople do get lonely,\u201d Grant said. He thought he saw his chance now. \u201cIf they\u2019re deprived of seeing somebody they care about, they do feel sad. Fiona, for instance. My wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said you went and visited her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d\n\nThen he took the plunge, going on to make the request he\u2019d come to make. Could she consider taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake, maybe just one day a week, for a visit? It was only a drive of a few miles. Or if she\u2019d like to take the time off\u2014Grant hadn\u2019t thought of this before and was rather dismayed to hear himself suggest it\u2014then he himself could take Aubrey out there, he wouldn\u2019t mind at all. He was sure he could manage it. While he talked she moved her closed lips and her hidden tongue as if she were trying to identify some dubious flavor. She brought milk for his coffee and a plate of ginger cookies.\n\n\u201cHomemade,\u201d she said as she set the plate down. There was challenge rather than hospitality in her tone. She said nothing more until she had sat down, poured milk into her coffee, and stirred it.\n\nThen she said no.\n\n\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do that. And the reason is, I\u2019m not going to upset him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould it upset him?\u201d Grant said earnestly.\n\n\u201cYes, it would. It would. That\u2019s no way to do. Bringing him home and taking him back. That would just confuse him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t he understand that it was just a visit? Wouldn\u2019t he get into the pattern of it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe understands everything all right.\u201d She said this as if he had offered an insult to Aubrey. \u201cBut it\u2019s still an interruption. And then I\u2019ve got to get him all ready and get him into the car, and he\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s not so easy to manage as you might think. I\u2019ve got to maneuver him into the car and pack his chair and all that and what for? If I go to all that trouble I\u2019d prefer to take him someplace that was more fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even if I agreed to do it?\u201d Grant said, keeping his tone hopeful and reasonable. \u201cIt\u2019s true, you shouldn\u2019t have the trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him. You couldn\u2019t handle him. He wouldn\u2019t stand for you doing for him. All that bother and what would he get out of it?\u201d\n\nGrant didn\u2019t think he should mention Fiona again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d make more sense to take him to the mall,\u201d she said. \u201cOr now the lake boats are starting to run again, he might get a charge out of going and watching that.\u201d\n\nShe got up and fetched her cigarettes and lighter from the window above the sink.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d she said.\n\nHe said no, thanks, though he didn\u2019t know if a cigarette was being offered.\n\n\u201cDid you never? Or did you quit?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d\n\nHe thought about it.\n\n\u201cThirty years. No\u2014more.\u201d\n\nHe had decided to quit around the time he started up with Jacqui. But he couldn\u2019t remember whether he quit first, and thought a big reward was coming to him for quitting, or thought that the time had come to quit, now that he had such a powerful diversion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve quit quitting,\u201d she said, lighting up. \u201cJust made a resolution to quit quitting, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nMaybe that was the reason for the wrinkles. Somebody\u2014a woman\u2014had told him that women who smoked developed a special set of fine facial wrinkles. But it could have been from the sun, or just the nature of her skin\u2014her neck was noticeably wrinkled as well. Wrinkled neck, youthfully full and uptilted breasts. Women of her age usually had these contradictions. The bad and good points, the genetic luck or lack of it, all mixed up together. Very few kept their beauty whole, though shadowy, as Fiona had done. And perhaps that wasn\u2019t even true. Perhaps he only thought that because he\u2019d known Fiona when she was young. When Aubrey looked at his wife did he see a high-school girl full of scorn and sass, with a tilt to her blue eyes, pursing her fruity lips around a forbidden cigarette?\n\n\u201cSo your wife\u2019s depressed?\u201d Aubrey\u2019s wife said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your wife\u2019s name? I forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Fiona.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiona. And what\u2019s yours? I don\u2019t think I was ever told that.\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cIt\u2019s Grant.\u201d\n\nShe stuck her hand out unexpectedly across the table.\n\n\u201cHello, Grant. I\u2019m Marian.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now we know each other\u2019s names,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no point in not telling you straight out what I think. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still so stuck on seeing your\u2014on seeing Fiona. Or not. I don\u2019t ask him and he\u2019s not telling me. Maybe just a passing fancy. But I don\u2019t feel like taking him back there in case it turns out to be more than that. I can\u2019t afford to risk it. I don\u2019t want him upset and carrying on. I\u2019ve got my hands full with him as it is. I don\u2019t have any help. It\u2019s just me here. I\u2019m it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever consider\u2014I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very hard for you\u2014\u201d Grant said. \u201cDid you ever consider his going in there for good?\u201d\n\nHe had lowered his voice almost to a whisper but she did not seem to feel a need to lower hers.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m keeping him right here.\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cWell. That\u2019s very good and noble of you.\u201d He hoped the word \u201cnoble\u201d had not sounded sarcastic. He had not meant it to be.\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d she said. \u201cNoble is not what I\u2019m thinking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cStill. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t. But the way I am, I don\u2019t have much choice. I don\u2019t have the money to put him in there unless I sell the house. The house is what we own outright. Otherwise I don\u2019t have anything in the way of resources. Next year I\u2019ll have his pension and my pension, but even so I couldn\u2019t afford to keep him there and hang on to the house. And it means a lot to me, my house does.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice,\u201d said Grant.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s all right. I put a lot into it. Fixing it up and keeping it up. I don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I see your point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company left us high and dry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know all the ins and outs of it but basically he got shoved out. It ended up with them saying he owed them money and when I tried to find out what was what he just went on saying it\u2019s none of my business. What I think is he did something pretty stupid. But I\u2019m not supposed to ask so I shut up. You\u2019ve been married. You are married. You know how it is. And in the middle of me finding out about this we\u2019re supposed to go on this trip and can\u2019t get out of it. And on the trip he takes sick from this virus you never heard of and goes into a coma. So that pretty well gets him off the hook.\u201d\n\nGrant said, \u201cBad luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean he got sick on purpose. It just happened. He\u2019s not mad at me anymore and I\u2019m not mad at him. It\u2019s just life. You can\u2019t beat life.\u201d\n\nShe flicked her tongue in a cat\u2019s businesslike way across her top lip, getting the cookie crumbs. \u201cI sound like I\u2019m quite the philosopher, don\u2019t I? They told me out there you used to be a university professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite a while ago,\u201d Grant said.\n\n\u201cI bet I know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking there\u2019s a mercenary type of a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making judgments of that sort. It\u2019s your life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou bet it is.\u201d\n\nHe thought they should end on a more neutral note. So he asked her if her husband had worked in a hardware store in the summers, when he was going to school.\n\n\u201cI never heard about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t raised here.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nGrant realized he\u2019d failed with Aubrey\u2019s wife. Marian. He had thought that what he\u2019d have to contend with would be a woman\u2019s natural sexual jealousy\u2014or her resentment, the stubborn remains of sexual jealousy. He had not had any idea of the way she might be looking at things. And yet in some depressing way the conversation had not been unfamiliar to him. That was because it reminded him of conversations he\u2019d had with people in his own family. His relatives, probably even his mother, had thought the way Marian thought. Money first. They had believed that when other people did not think that way it was because they had lost touch with reality. That was how Marian would see him, certainly. A silly person, full of boring knowledge and protected by some fluke from the truth about life. A person who didn\u2019t have to worry about holding on to his house and could go around dreaming up the fine generous schemes that he believed would make another person happy. What a jerk, she would be thinking now.\n\nBeing up against a person like that made him feel hopeless, exasperated, finally almost desolate. Why? Because he couldn\u2019t be sure of holding on to himself, against people like that? Because he was afraid that in the end they were right? Yet he might have married her. Or some girl like that. If he\u2019d stayed back where he belonged. She\u2019d have been appetizing enough. Probably a flirt. The fussy way she had of shifting her buttocks on the kitchen chair, her pursed mouth, a slightly contrived air of menace\u2014that was what was left of the more or less innocent vulgarity of a small-town flirt.\n\nShe must have had some hopes when she picked Aubrey. His good looks, his salesman\u2019s job, his white-collar expectations. She must have believed that she would end up better off than she was now. And so it often happened with those practical people. In spite of their calculations, their survival instincts, they might not get as far as they had quite reasonably expected. No doubt it seemed unfair.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the kitchen the first thing he saw was the light blinking on his answering machine. He thought the same thing he always thought now. Fiona. He pressed the button before he took his coat off.\n\n\u201cHello, Grant. I hope I got the right person. I just thought of something. There is a dance here in town at the Legion supposed to be for singles on Saturday night and I am on the lunch committee, which means I can bring a free guest. So I wondered whether you would happen to be interested in that? Call me back when you get a chance.\u201d\n\nA woman\u2019s voice gave a local number. Then there was a beep and the same voice started talking again.\n\n\u201cI just realized I\u2019d forgotten to say who it was. Well, you probably recognized the voice. It\u2019s Marian. I\u2019m still not so used to these machines. And I wanted to say I realize you\u2019re not a single and I don\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019m not either, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to get out once in a while. If you are interested you can call me and if you are not you don\u2019t need to bother. I just thought you might like the chance to get out. It\u2019s Marian speaking. I guess I already said that. O.K. then. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nHer voice on the machine was different from the voice he\u2019d heard a short time ago in her house. Just a little different in the first message, more so in the second. A tremor of nerves there, an affected nonchalance, a hurry to get through and a reluctance to let go.\n\nSomething had happened to her. But when had it happened? If it had been immediate, she had concealed it very successfully all the time he was with her. More likely it came on her gradually, maybe after he\u2019d gone away. Not necessarily as a blow of attraction. Just the realization that he was a possibility, a man on his own. More or less on his own. A possibility that she might as well try to follow up.\n\nBut she\u2019d had the jitters when she made the first move. She had put herself at risk. How much of herself he could not yet tell. Generally a woman\u2019s vulnerability increased as time went on, as things progressed. All you could tell at the start was that if there was an edge of it then, there\u2019d be more later. It gave him a satisfaction\u2014why deny it?\u2014to have brought that out in her. To have roused something like a shimmer, a blurring, on the surface of her personality. To have heard in her testy broad vowels this faint plea.\n\nHe set out the eggs and mushrooms to make himself an omelette. Then he thought he might as well pour a drink.\n\nAnything was possible. Was that true\u2014was anything possible? For instance, if he wanted to, would he be able to break her down, get her to the point where she might listen to him about taking Aubrey back to Fiona? And not just for visits but for the rest of Aubrey\u2019s life. And what would become of him and Marian after he\u2019d delivered Aubrey to Fiona?\n\nMarian would be sitting in her house now, waiting for him to call. Or probably not sitting. Doing things to keep herself busy. She might have fed Aubrey while Grant was buying the mushrooms and driving home. She might now be preparing him for bed. But all the time she would be conscious of the phone, of the silence of the phone. Maybe she would have calculated how long it would take Grant to drive home. His address in the phone book would have given her a rough idea of where he lived. She would calculate how long, then add to that the time it might take him to shop for supper (figuring that a man alone would shop every day). Then a certain amount of time for him to get around to listening to his messages. And as the silence persisted she\u2019d think of other things. Other errands he might have had to do before he got home. Or perhaps a dinner out, a meeting that meant he would not get home at suppertime at all.\n\nWhat conceit on his part. She was above all things a sensible woman. She would go to bed at her regular time thinking that he didn\u2019t look as if he\u2019d be a decent dancer anyway. Too stiff, too professorial.\n\nHe stayed near the phone, looking at magazines, but he didn\u2019t pick it up when it rang again.\n\n\u201cGrant. This is Marian. I was down in the basement putting the wash in the dryer and I heard the phone and when I got upstairs whoever it was had hung up. So I just thought I ought to say I was here. If it was you and if you are even home. Because I don\u2019t have a machine, obviously, so you couldn\u2019t leave a message. So I just wanted. To let you know.\u201d The time was now twenty-five after ten.\n\n\u201cBye.\u201d\n\nHe would say that he\u2019d just got home. There was no point in bringing to her mind the picture of his sitting here weighing the pros and cons.\n\nDrapes. That would be her word for the blue curtains\u2014drapes. And why not? He thought of the ginger cookies so perfectly round that she had to announce they were homemade, the ceramic coffee mugs on their ceramic tree, a plastic runner, he was sure, protecting the hall carpet. A high-gloss exactness and practicality that his mother had never achieved but would have admired\u2014was that why he could feel this twinge of bizarre and unreliable affection? Or was it because he\u2019d had two more drinks after the first?\n\nThe walnut-stain tan\u2014he believed now that it was a tan\u2014of her face and neck would most likely continue into her cleavage, which would be deep, cr\u00eapey-skinned, odorous and hot. He had that to think of as he dialled the number that he had already written down. That and the practical sensuality of her cat\u2019s tongue. Her gemstone eyes.\n\n* * *\n\nFiona was in her room but not in bed. She was sitting by the open window, wearing a seasonable but oddly short and bright dress. Through the window came a heady warm blast of lilacs in bloom and the spring manure spread over the fields.\n\nShe had a book open in her lap.\n\nShe said, \u201cLook at this beautiful book I found. It\u2019s about Iceland. You wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019d leave valuable books lying around in the rooms. But I think they\u2019ve got the clothes mixed up\u2014I never wear yellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiona,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAre we all checked out now?\u201d she said. He thought the brightness of her voice was wavering a little. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFiona, I\u2019ve brought a surprise for you. Do you remember Aubrey?\u201d\n\nShe stared at Grant for a moment, as if waves of wind had come beating into her face. Into her face, into her head, pulling everything to rags. All rags and loose threads.\n\n\u201cNames elude me,\u201d she said harshly.\n\nThen the look passed away as she retrieved, with an effort, some bantering grace. She set the book down carefully and stood up and lifted her arms to put them around him.

T-Top]\nYesterday at the faceoffs, you told me that you played college football right?\nI did my research\nThey said that boy's a star\nBut then his grades wasn't adding up\nSo the school had to call it off\nHe started rapping\nThen his coaches didn't call at all\nHe had to place football behind bars like the longest yard\nNow that's another story\nY'all gave the bear a college dropout\nYay (Ye)\nThis must be a cover story\nBut he got nothing for me\nSo just wait until I get a Glock\nThey asking why not take Swamp on this card instead of Dot?\nI told them I'm a dig his plot\nBut Summer Madness the Grammy's\nAnd I ain't Dr. Miami so I ain't into giving bitches shots\nNow back to how you missed your shot\nTh3 Saga created it playa, but I don't like the way he told the story\nSo if you gon' get mad then (Madden) consider this your road to glory\nDawg, you was wild lucky\nEverybody was believing in yo ass\nThey said you could be the greatest, if only he could pass\nYou failed them\nYou was supposed to be the leader of the pack\nActing woke for the people but you was sleeping in your class\nIs that the reason why you mad?\nCause you was flunking back in LA?\nSurrounded by Cholos and Vatos\nBut learned nothing from them Eses (essays)\nSee\nSee\nSee to preach to me dawg\nTo preach to me dawg\nYou gotta be accepting of your own flaws\nReflecting on your own loss\nBut you couldn't even focus on your homework\nSo stop telling me you go hard\nCause my dawg caught a felony in high school\nAnd he still graduated with that F on his report card\nNigga\nSo if you ask me dawg then you the one wilding\nYou went from possibly getting a million dollar NFL contract\nTo a URL thousand\nDawg\nDon't you see how you could have been doing interviews with Big Shaq, you know, Shannon Sharpe?\nNow it's just interviews with Jay Blac and Anwar\nI guess you the real champion now\nDawg I knew this was a body the moment Smack hand me the files\nI said he quitting or fixing the kitchen floor\nEither way he gotta hand in the towel\nBut we gon' handle it now\nBut we gon' handle it now\nAnd I ain't got nothing against the lame\nBut you been lost since a kid even your mother probably feel the pain\nYou couldn't even keep up with the dish she brought you\nMan that shits a shame\nHe be like \"Ma you seen my EA Spo-\"\nBitch it's in the game\nNow his friends can't even get on the sticks with him\nHe make them feel the pressure\nHe be like \"Yeah that was nice, but in real life I could've did it better\"\nAnd that's the part that had me bursting out laughing\nCause you could've had the Madden curse nigga\nNow you at home just cursing out Madden\nTelling your kids old stories like\n\"Daddy was the man on the field, the crowd love me \"\nHe always talking about his high school days\nHe Al Bundy\nThat's why I'm straight confused\nThat's why I'm straight confused\nOn the message that you use to convey the youth\nCause you like teaching them Black power\nYo dumbass should be telling them to stay in school\nAnd I know why you wasn't conscious in school\nCause you ain't have the balls to carry it\nYou was more focused on the game and the ball you carrying\nNow you woke, lying to the people with all this arrogance\nBut where was Pan-African\nWhen you was tryna be All-American?\nNigga\nNigga\nNow you moving like Lux when you rap\nI mean you always had his way with words\nBut you went from doing the Heisman\nTo the DJ moves\nWell ain't it funny how the tables turn?\nSee see see\nSee you had a way out the hood bro, you really could've been set with paper\nYou from Cali, you could've played for the Rams or even been a Raider\nNow you stuck in the hood as a rapper\nI guess it's second nature\nWell just know you made yourself a stereotype\nAnd that's just for the record, player\nI mean, damn\nI bet your moms thought you was at the top of the class or even the team\nThought you would make it out of school and go straight for the league\nCollege shit, scholarships\nBut what did it mean?\nSee you could say I sold my momma anything\nExcept for a dream, pussy\nAnd that ain't nothing to laugh at scrat\nThat ain't nothing to laugh at scrat\nCause he was headed for the Super Bowl\nAnd barely made the Super Bowl of battle rap\nAnd if you tell niggas you deserve this card\nYou're a fucking liar\nThat's why they got my face on a billboard\nAnd yours on the fucking flyer\nAnd the worst part about is\nAin't Caffeine headquarters stationed in Cali?\nAnd they ain't paid one red cent to put your face up in Cali\nNow that would straight up embarrass me\nNot falling on a stage\nI went from Mook to you pussy, I'm falling anyway\nConcrete\n[Round 1: B.

Kid de Blits)", "releaseDateComponents": {"year": 2019, "month": 2, "day": 2}}, {"songID": 334154, "lyrics": "1 ContributorA Confederacy of Dunces (Chap. 2.3) Lyrics Patrolman Mancuso enjoyed riding the motorcycle up St. Charles Avenue. At the precinct he had borrowed a large and loud one that was all chromium and baby blue, and at the touch of a switch it could become a pinball machine of flashing, winking, blinking red and white lights. The siren, a cacophany of twelve crazed bobcats, was enough to make suspicious characters within a half-mile radius defecate in panic and rush for cover. Patrolman Mancuso\u2019s love for the motorcycle was platonically intense.\n\n The forces of evil generated by the hideous and apparently impossible to uncover underground of suspicious characters seemed remote to him this afternoon, though. The ancient oaks of St. Charles Avenue arched over the avenue like a canopy shielding him from the mild winter sun that splashed and sparkled on the chrome of the motorcycle. Although the days had lately been cold and damp, the afternoon had that sudden, surprising warmth that makes New Orleans winters gentle. Patrolman Mancuso appreciated the mildness, for he was wearing only a T-shirt and Bermuda shorts, the sergeant\u2019s costume selection for the day. The long red beard that hooked over his ears by means of wires did manage to warm his chest a little; he had snatched the beard from the locker while the sergeant wasn't looking.\n\n Patrolman Mancuso inhaled the moldy scent of the oaks and thought, in a romantic aside, that St. Charles Avenue must be the loveliest place in the world. From time to time he passed the slowly rocking streetcars that seemed to be leisurely moving toward no special destination, following their route through the old mansions on either side of the avenue. Everything looked so calm, so prosperous, so un-suspicious. On his own time he was going up to see that poor Widow Reilly. She had looked so pitiful crying in the middle of that wreck. The least he could do was try to help her.\n\n At Constantinople Street he turned toward the river, sputtering and growling through a declining neighborhood until he reached a block of houses built in the 1880s and 90s, wooden Gothic and Gilded Age relics that dripped carving and scroll-work, Boss Tweed suburban stereotypes separated by alleys so narrow that a yardstick could almost bridge them and fenced in by iron pikes and low walls of crumbling brick. The larger houses had become impromptu apartment buildings, their porches converted into additional rooms. In some of the front-yards there were aluminum carports, and bright aluminum awnings had been installed on one or two of the buildings. It was a neighborhood that had degenerated from Victorian to nothing in particular, a block that had moved into the twentieth century carelessly and uncaring and with very limited funds.\n\n The address that Patrolman Mancuso was looking for was the tiniest structure on the block, aside from the carports, a Lilliput of the eighties. A frozen banana tree, brown and stricken, languished against the front of the porch, the tree preparing to collapse as the iron fence had done long ago. Near the dead tree there was a slight mound of earth and a leaning Celtic cross cut from plywood. The 1946 Plymouth was parked in the front-yard, its bumper pressed against the porch, its taillights blocking the brick sidewalk. But, except for the Plymouth and the weathered cross and the mummified banana tree, the tiny yard was completely bare. There were no shrubs. There was no grass. And no birds sang.\n\n Patrolman Mancuso looked at the Plymouth and saw the deep crease in its roof and the fender, filled with concave circles, that was separated from the body by three or four inches of space. VAN CAMP\u2019S PORK AND BEANS was printed on the piece of cardboard taped across the hole that had been the rear window. Stopping by the grave, he read REX in faded letters on the cross. Then he climbed the worn brick steps and heard through the closed shutters a booming chant.\n\n Big girls don\u2019t cry.\n Big girls don\u2019t cry.\n Big girls, they don\u2019t cry-yi-yi.\n They don\u2019t cry.\n Big girls, they don\u2019t cry...yi.\n\n While he was waiting for someone to answer the bell, he read the faded sticker on the crystal of the door, \u201cA slip of the lip can sink a ship.\u201d Below a WAVE held her finger to lips that had turned tan.\n\n Along the block some people were out on their porches looking at him and the motorcycle. The shutters across the street that slowly flipped up and down to get the proper focus indicated that he also had a considerable unseen audience, for a police motorcycle in the block was an event, especially if its driver wore shorts and a red beard. The block was poor, certainly, but honest. Suddenly self-conscious, Patrolman Mancuso rang the bell again and assumed what he considered his erect, official posture. He gave his audience his Mediterranean profile, but the audience saw only a small and sallow figure whose shorts hung clumsily in the crotch, whose spindly legs looked too naked in comparison to the formal garters and nylon socks that hung near the ankles. The audience remained curious, but unimpressed; a few were not even especially curious, the few who had expected some such vision to visit that miniature house eventually.\n\n Big girls don\u2019t cry\n Big girls don\u2019t cry.\n Patrolman Mancuso knocked savagely at the shutters.\n Big girls don\u2019t cry.\n Big girls don\u2019t cry.\n \u201cThey home,\u201d a woman screamed through the shutters of the house next door, an architect\u2019s vision of Jay Could domestic. \u201cMiss Reilly\u2019s prolly in the kitchen. Go around the back. What are you, mister? A cop?\u201d\n\n \u201cPatrolman Mancuso. Undercover,\u201d he answered sternly.\n\n \u201cYeah?\u201d There was a moment of silence. \u201cWhich one you want, the boy or the mother?\u201d\n\n \u201cThe mother.\u201d\n\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s good. You\u2019d never get a hold of him. He\u2019s watching the TV. You hear that? It\u2019s driving me nuts. My nerves is shot.\u201d\n\n Patrolman Mancuso thanked the woman\u2019s voice and walked into the dank alley. In the back yard he found Mrs. Reilly hanging a spotted and yellowed sheet on a line that ran through the bare fig trees.\n\n \u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said after a moment. She had almost started to scream when she saw the map with the red beard appear in her yard. \u201cHow you doing, Mr. Mancuso? What them people said?\u201d She stepped cautiously over the broken brick paving in her brown felt moccasins. \u201cCome on in the house and we\u2019ll have us a nice cup of coffee.\u201d\n\n The kitchen was a large, high-ceilinged room, the largest in the house, and it smelled of coffee and old newspapers. Like every room in the house, it was dark; the greasy wallpaper and brown wooden moldings would have transformed any light into gloom, and from the alley very little light filtered in anyway. Although the interiors of homes did not interest Patrolman Mancuso, still he did notice, as anyone would have, the antique stove with the high oven and the refrigerator with the cylindrical motor on top. Thinking of the electric fryers, gas driers, mechanical mixers and beaters, waffle plates, and motorized rotisseries that seemed to be always whirring, grinding, beating, cooling, hissing, and broiling in the lunar kitchen of his wife, Rita, he wondered what Mrs. Reilly did in this sparse room. Whenever a new appliance was advertised on television, Mrs. Mancuso bought it no matter how obscure its uses were.\n\n \u201cNow tell me what the man said.\u201d Mrs. Reilly began boiling a pot of milk on her Edwardian gas stove. \u201cHow much I gotta pay? You told him I was a poor widow with a child to support, huh?\u201d\n\n \u201cYeah, I told him that,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said, sitting erectly in his chair and looking hopefully at the kitchen table covered with oilcloth. \u201cDo you mind if I put my beard on the table? It\u2019s kinda hot in here and it\u2019s sticking my face.\u201d\n\n \u201cSure, go ahead, babe. Here. Have a nice jelly doughnut. I just bought them fresh this morning over by Magazine Street. Ignatius says to me this morning, \u2018Momma, I sure feel like a jelly doughnut.\u2019 You know? So I went over by the German and bought him two dozen. Look, they got a few left.\u201d\n\n She offered Patrolman Mancuso a torn and oily cake box that looked as if it had been subjected to unusual abuse during someone\u2019s attempt to take all of the doughnuts at once. At the bottom of the box Patrolman Mancuso found two withered pieces of doughnut out of which, judging by their moist edges, the jelly had been sucked.\n\n \u201cThank you anyway, Miss Reilly. I had me a big lunch.\u201d\n \u201cAw, ain\u2019t that a shame.\u201d She filled two cups half full with thick cold coffee and poured the boiling milk in up to the rim. \u201cIgnatius loves his doughnuts. He says to me, \u2018Momma, I love my doughnuts.\u2019\u201d Mrs. Reilly slurped a bit at the rim of her cup. \u201cHe\u2019s out in the parlor right now looking at TV. Every afternoon, as right as rain, he looks at that show where them kids dance.\u201d In the kitchen the music was somewhat fainter than it had been on the porch. Patrolman Mancuso pictured the green hunting cap bathed in the blue-white glow of the television screen. \u201cHe don\u2019t like the show at all, but he won\u2019t miss it. You oughta hear what he says about them poor kids.\u201d\n\n \u201cI spoke with the man this morning,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said, hoping that Mrs. Reilly had exhausted the subject of her son.\n\n \u201cYeah?\u201d She put three spoons of sugar in her coffee and, holding the spoon in the cup with her thumb so that the handle threatened to puncture her eyeball, she slurped a bit more. \u201cWhat he said, honey?\u201d\n\n \u201cI told him I investigated the accident and that you just skidded on a wet street.\u201d\n\n \u201cThat sounds good. So what he said then, babe?\u201d\n\n \u201cHe said he don\u2019t want to go to court. He wants a settlement now.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh, my God!\u201d Ignatius bellowed from the front of the house. \u201cWhat an egregious insult to good taste.\u201d\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t pay him no mind,\u201d Mrs. Reilly advised the startled policeman. \u201cHe does that all the time he looks at the TV. A \u2018settlement.\u2019 That means he wants some money, huh?\u201d\n\n \u201cHe even got a contractor to appraise the damage. Here, this is the estimate.\u201d\n\n Mrs. Reilly took the sheet of paper and read the typed column of itemized figures beneath the contractor\u2019s letterhead.\n\n \u201cLord! A thousand and twenty dollars. This is terrible. How I\u2019m gonna pay that?\u201d She dropped the estimate on the oilcloth. \u201cYou sure that is right?\u201d\n\n \u201cYes, ma\u2019m. He\u2019s got a lawyer working on it, too. It\u2019s all on the up and up.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhere I\u2019m gonna get a thousand dollars, though? All me and Ignatius got is my poor husband\u2019s Social Security and a little two-bit pension, and that don\u2019t come to much.\u201d\n \u201cDo I believe the total perversion that I am witnessing?\u201d Ignatius screamed from the parlor. The music had a frantic, tribal rhythm; a chorus of falsettos sang insinuatingly about loving all night long.\n\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said, almost heartbroken over Mrs. Reilly\u2019s financial quandary.\n\n \u201cAw, it\u2019s not your fault, darling,\u201d she said glumly. \u201cMaybe I can get a mortgage on the house. We can\u2019t do nothing about it, huh?\u201d\n\n \u201cNo, ma\u2019m,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso answered, listening to some sort of approaching stampede.\n\n \u201cThe children on that program should all be gassed,\u201d Ignatius said as he strode into the kitchen in his nightshirt. Then he noticed the guest and said coldly, \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n \u201cIgnatius, you know Mr. Mancuso. Say \u2018Hello.\u2019\u201d\n\n \u201cI do believe that I\u2019ve seen him about,\u201d Ignatius said and looked out the back door. Patrolman Mancuso was too startled by the monstrous flannel nightshirt to reply to Ignatius\u2019 pleasantry.\n\n \u201cIgnatius, honey, the man wants over a thousand dollars for what I did to his building.\u201d\n\n \u201cA thousand dollars? He will not get a cent. We shall have him prosecuted immediately. Contact our attorneys, Mother.\u201d\n\n \u201cOur attorneys? He\u2019s got a estimate from a contractor. Mr. Mancuso here says they\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh. Well, you shall have to pay him then.\u201d\n\n \u201cI could take it to court if you think it\u2019s best.\u201d\n\n \u201cDrunken driving,\u201d Ignatius said calmly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t a chance.\u201d\n\n Mrs. Reilly looked depressed.\n\n \u201cBut Ignatius, a thousand twenty dollars.\u201d\n\n \u201cI am certain that you can procure some funds,\u201d he told her. \u201cIs there any more coffee, or have you given the last to this carnival masker?\u201d\n\n \u201cWe can mortgage the house.\u201d\n\n \u201cMortgage the house? Of course we won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat else we gonna do, Ignatius?\u201d\n\n \u201cThere are means,\u201d Ignatius said absently. \u201cI wish that you wouldn\u2019t bother me with this. That program always increases my anxiety anyway.\u201d He smelled the milk before putting it into the pot. \u201cI would suggest that you telephone that dairy immediately. This milk is quite aged.\u201d\n\n \u201cI can get a thousand dollars over by the Homestead,\u201d Mrs. Reilly told the silent patrolman quietly. \u201cThe house is good security. I had me a real estate agent offered me seven thousand last year.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe ironic thing about that program,\u201d Ignatius was saying over the stove, keeping one eye peeled so that he could seize the pot as soon as the milk began to boil, \u201cis that it is supposed to be an exemplum to the youth of our nation. I would like very much to know what the Founding Fathers would say if they could see these children being debauched to further the cause of Clearasil. However, I always suspected that democracy would come to this.\u201d He painstakingly poured the milk into his Shirley Temple mug. \u201cA firm rule must be imposed upon our nation before it destroys itself. The United States needs some theology and geometry, some taste and decency. I suspect that we are teetering on the edge of the abyss.\u201d\n\n \u201cIgnatius, I\u2019m gonna have to go by the Homestead tomorrow.\u201d\n\n \u201cWe shall not deal with those usurers, Mother.\u201d Ignatius was feeling around in the cookie jar. \u201cSomething will turn up.\u201d\n\n \u201cIgnatius, honey, they can put me in jail.\u201d\n\n \u201cHo hum. If you are going to stage one of your hysterical scenes, I shall have to return to the living room. As a matter of fact, I think I will.\u201d\n\n He billowed out again in the direction of the music, the shower shoes flapping loudly against the soles of his huge feet.\n\n \u201cWhat I\u2019m gonna do with a boy like that?\u201d Mrs. Reilly sadly asked Patrolman Mancuso. \u201cHe don\u2019t care about his poor dear mother. Sometimes I think Ignatius wouldn\u2019t mind if they did throw me in jail. He\u2019s got a heart of ice, that boy.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou spoiled him,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said. \u201cA woman\u2019s gotta watch she don\u2019t spoil her kids.\u201d\n\n \u201cHow many chirren you got, Mr. Mancuso?\u201d\n\n \u201cThree. Rosalie, Antoinette, and Angelo, Jr.\u201d\n\n \u201cAw, ain\u2019t that nice. I bet they sweet, huh? Not like Ignatius.\u201d Mrs. Reilly shook her head. \u201cIgnatius was such a precious child. I don\u2019t know what made him change. He used to say to me, \u2018Momma, I love you.\u2019 He don\u2019t say that no more.\u201d\n\n \u201cAw, don\u2019t cry,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said, deeply moved. \u201cI\u2019ll make you some more coffee.\u201d\n\n \u201cHe don\u2019t care if they lock me up,\u201d Mrs. Reilly sniffed. She opened the oven and took out a bottle of muscatel. \u201cYou want some nice wine, Mr. Mancuso?\u201d\n\n \u201cNo thanks. Being on the force, I gotta make a impression. I gotta always be on the lookout for people, too.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou don\u2019t mind?\u201d Mrs. Reilly asked rhetorically and took a long drink from the bottle. Patrolman Mancuso began boiling the milk, hovering over the stove in a very domestic manner. \u201cSometimes I sure get the blues. Life\u2019s hard. I worked hard, too. I been\ngood.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou oughta look on the bright side,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said.\n\n \u201cI guess so,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said. \u201cSome people got it harder than me, I guess. Like my poor cousin, wonderful woman. Went to mass every day of her life. She got knocked down by a streetcar over on Magazine Street early one morning while she was on her way to Fisherman\u2019s Mass. It was still dark out.\u201d\n\n \u201cPersonally, I never let myself get low,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso lied. \u201cYou gotta look up. You know what I mean? I got a dangerous line of work.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou could get yourself killed.\u201d\n\n \u201cSometimes I don\u2019t apprehend nobody all day. Sometimes I apprehend the wrong person.\u201d\n\n \u201cLike that old man in front of D. H. Holmes. That\u2019s my fault, Mr. Mancuso. I shoulda guessed Ignatius was wrong all along. It\u2019s just like him. All the time I\u2019m telling him, \u2018Ignatius, here, put on this nice shirt. Put on this nice sweater I bought you.\u2019 But he don\u2019t listen. Not that boy. He\u2019s got a head like a rock.\u201d\n\n \u201cThen sometimes I get problems at home. With three kids, my wife\u2019s very nervous.\u201d\n\n \u201cNerves is a terrible thing. Poor Miss Annie, the next-door lady, she\u2019s got nerves; Always screaming about Ignatius making noise.\u201d\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s my wife. Sometimes I gotta get outta the house. If I was another kind of man, sometimes I could really go get myself good and drunk. Just between us.\u201d\n\n \u201cI gotta have my little drink. It relieves the pressure. You know?\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat I do is go bowl.\u201d\n\n Mrs. Reilly tried to imagine little Patrolman Mancuso with a big bowling ball and said, \u201cYou like that, huh?\u201d\n\n \u201cBowling\u2019s wonderful, Miss Reilly. It takes your mind off things.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh, my heavens!\u201d a voice shouted from the parlor. \u201cThese girls are doubtless prostitutes already. How can they present horrors like this to the public?\u201d\n\n \u201cI wish I had me a hobby like that.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou oughta try bowling.\u201d\n\n \u201cAy-yi-yi. I already got arthuritis in my elbow. I\u2019m too old to play around with them balls. I\u2019d wrench my back.\u201d\n\n \u201cI got a aunt, sixty-five, a grammaw, and she goes bowling all the time. She\u2019s even on a team.\u201d\n\n \u201cSome women are like that. Me, I never was much for sports.\u201d\n\n \u201cBowling\u2019s more than a sport,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said defensively. \u201cYou meet plenty people over by the alley. Nice people. You could make you some friends.\u201d\n\n \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s just my luck to drop one of them balls on my toe. I got bum feet already.\u201d\n\n \u201cNext time I go by the alley, I\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019ll bring my aunt. You and me and my aunt, we\u2019ll go down by the alley. Okay?\u201d\n\n \u201cMother, when was this coffee dripped?\u201d Ignatius demanded, flapping into the kitchen again.\n\n \u201cJust about a hour ago. Why?\u201d\n\n \u201cIt certainly tastes brackish.\u201d\n\n \u201cI thought it was very good,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said. \u201cJust as good as they serve at the French Market. I\u2019m making some more now. You want a cup?\u201d\n\n \u201cPardon me,\u201d Ignatius said. \u201cMother, are you going to entertain this gentleman all afternoon? I would like to remind you that I am going to the movies tonight and that I am due at the theater promptly at seven so that I can see the cartoon. I would suggest that you begin preparing something to eat.\u201d\n\n \u201cI better go,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said.\n\n \u201cIgnatius, you oughta be ashamed,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said in an angry voice. \u201cMe and Mr. Mancuso here just having some coffee. You been nasty all afternoon. You don\u2019t care where I raise that money. You don\u2019t care if they lock me up. You don\u2019t care about nothing.\u201d\n\n \u201cAm I going to be attacked in my own home before a stranger with a false beard?\u201d\n\n \u201cMy heart\u2019s broke.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh, really.\u201d Ignatius turned on Patrolman Mancuso. \u201cWill you kindly leave? You are inciting my mother.\u201d\n\n \u201cMr. Mancuso\u2019s not doing nothing but being nice.\u201d\n\n \u201cI better go,\u201d Patrolman Mancuso said apologetically.\n\n \u201cI\u2019ll get that money,\u201d Mrs. Reilly screamed. \u201cI\u2019ll sell this house. I\u2019ll sell it out from under you, boy. I\u2019ll go stay by a old folks\u2019 home.\u201d\n\n She grabbed an end of the oilcloth and wiped her eyes.\n\n \u201cIf you do not leave,\u201d Ignatius said to Patrolman Mancuso, who was hooking on his beard, \u201cI shall call the police.\u201d\n\n \u201cHe is the police, stupid.\u201d\n\n \u201cThis is totally absurd,\u201d Ignatius said and flapped away. \u201cI am going to my room.\u201d He slammed his door and snatched a Big Chief tablet from the floor. Throwing himself back among the pillows on the bed, he began doodling on a yellowed page. After almost thirty minutes of pulling at his hair and chewing on the pencil, he began to compose a paragraph.\n\n Were Hroswitha with us today, we would all look to her for counsel and guidance. From the austerity and tranquility of her medieval world, the penetrating gaze of this legendary Sybil of a holy nun would exorcise the horrors which materialize before our eyes in the name of television. If we could only juxtapose one eyeball of this sanctified woman and a television tube, both being roughly of the same shape and design, what a phantasmagoria of exploding electrodes would occur. The images of those lasciviously gyrating children would disintegrate into so many ions and molecules, thereby effecting the catharsis which the tragedy of the debauching of the innocent necessarily demands.\n\n Mrs. Reilly stood in the hall looking at the DO NOT DISTURB sign printed on a sheet of Big Chief paper and stuck to the door by an old flesh-colored Band-aid.\n\n \u201cIgnatius, let me in there, boy,\u201d she screamed.\n\n \u201cLet you in here?\u201d Ignatius said through the door. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t. I am occupied at the moment with an especially succinct passage.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou let me in.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou know that you are never allowed in here.\u201d\n\n Mrs. Reilly pounded at the door.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening to you, Mother, but I suspect that you are momentarily deranged. Now that I think of it, I am too frightened to open the door. You may have a knife or a broken wine bottle.\u201d\n\n \u201cOpen up this door, Ignatius.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh, my valve! It\u2019s closing!\u201d Ignatius groaned loudly. \u201cAre you satisfied now that you have ruined me for the rest of the evening?\u201d\n\n Mrs. Reilly threw herself against the unpainted wood.\n\n \u201cWell, don\u2019t break the door,\u201d he said finally and, after a few moments, the bolt slid open.\n\n \u201cIgnatius, what\u2019s all this trash on the floor?\u201d\n\n \u201cThat is my worldview that you see. It still must be incorporated into a whole, so be careful where you step.\u201d\n\n \u201cAnd all the shutters closed: Ignatius! It\u2019s still light outside.\u201d\n\n \u201cMy being is not without its Proustian elements,\u201d Ignatius said from the bed, to which he had quickly returned. \u201cOh, my stomach.\u201d\n\n \u201cIt smells terrible in here.\u201d\n\n \u201cWell, what do you expect? The human body, when confined, produces certain odors which we tend to forget in this age of deodorants and other perversions. Actually, I find the atmosphere of this room rather comforting. Schiller needed the scent of apples rotting in his desk in order to write. I, too, have my needs. You may remember that Mark Twain preferred to lie supinely in bed while composing those rather dated and boring efforts which contemporary scholars try to prove meaningful. Veneration of Mark Twain is one of the roots of our current intellectual stalemate.\u201d\n\n \u201cIf I know it was like this, I\u2019d been in here long ago.\u201d\n\n \u201cI do not know why you are in here now, as a matter of fact, or why you have this sudden compulsion to invade my sanctuary. I doubt whether it will ever be the same after the trauma of this intrusion by an alien spirit.\u201d\n\n \u201cI came to talk to you, boy. Get your face out them pillows.\u201d\n\n \u201cThis must be the influence of that ludicrous representative of the law. He seems to have turned you against your own child. By the way, he has left, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n \u201cYes, and I apologized to him over the way you acted.\u201d\n\n \u201cMother, you are standing on my tablets. Will you please move a little? Isn\u2019t it enough that you have destroyed my digestion without destroying the fruits of my brain also?\u201d\n\n \u201cWell, where I\u2019m gonna stand, Ignatius? You want me to get in bed with you?\u201d Mrs. Reilly asked angrily.\n\n \u201cWatch out where you\u2019re stepping, please!\u201d Ignatius thundered. \u201cMy God, never has anyone been so totally and so literally stormed and besieged. What is it anyway that has driven you in here in this state of complete mania? Could it be the stench of cheap muscatel that is assaulting my nostrils?\u201d\n\n \u201cI made up my mind. You gonna go out and get you a job.\u201d\n\n Oh, what low joke was Fortuna playing on him now? Arrest, accident, job. Where would this dreadful cycle ever end?\n\n \u201cI see,\u201d Ignatius said calmly. \u201cKnowing that you are congenitally incapable of arriving at a decision of this importance, I imagine that that mongoloid law officer put this idea into your head.\u201d\n\n \u201cMe and Mr. Mancuso talked like I used to talk to your poppa. You poppa used to tell me what to do. I wish he was alive today.\u201d\n\n \u201cMancuso and my father are alike only in that they both give the impression of being rather inconsequential humans. However, your current mentor is apparently the type of person who thinks that everything will be all right if everyone works continually.\u201d\n\n \u201cMr. Mancuso works hard. He\u2019s got a hard road at the precinct.\u201d\n\n \u201cI am certain that he supports several unwanted children who all hope to grow up to be policemen, the girls included.\u201d\n\n \u201cHe\u2019s got three sweet children.\u201d\n\n \u201cI can imagine.\u201d Ignatius began to bounce slowly. \u201cOh!\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you fooling with that valve again? Nobody else got him a valve but you. I ain\u2019t got no valve.\u201d\n\n \u201cEveryone has a valve!\u201d Ignatius screamed. \u201cMine is simply more developed. I am trying to open a passage which you have succeeded in blocking. It may be permanently closed now for all I know.\u201d\n\n \u201cMr. Mancuso says if you work you can help me payoff the man. He says he thinks the man might take the money in installments.\u201d\n\n \u201cYour friend the patrolman says a great deal. You certainly bring people out, as they say. I never suspected that he could be so loquacious or that he was capable of such perceptive comment. Do you realize that he is trying to destroy our home? It began the moment that he attempted that brutal arrest in front of D. H. Holmes. Although you are too limited to comprehend it all, Mother, this man is our nemesis. He\u2019s spun our wheel downward.\u201d\n\n \u201cWheel? Mr. Mancuso is a good man. You oughta be glad he didn\u2019t take you in!\u201d\n\n \u201cIn my private apocalypse he will be impaled upon his own nightstick. Anyway, it is inconceivable that I should get a job. I am very busy with my work at the moment, and I feel that I am entering a very fecund stage. Perhaps the accident jarred and loosened my thought. At any rate, I accomplished a great deal today.\u201d\n\n \u201cWe gotta pay that man, Ignatius. You wanna see me in jail? Wouldn\u2019t you be ashamed with your poor momma behind bars?\u201d\n\n \u201cWill you please stop talking about imprisonment? You seem to be preoccupied with the thought. Actually, you seem to enjoy thinking about it. Martyrdom is meaningless in our age.\u201d He belched quietly. \u201cI would suggest certain economies around the house. Somehow you will soon see that you have the required amount.\u201d\n\n \u201cI spend all the money on you for food and whatnots.\u201d\n\n \u201cI have found several empty wine bottles about lately, the contents of which I certainly did not consume.\u201d\n\n \u201cIgnatius!\u201d\n\n \u201cI made the mistake of heating the oven the other day before inspecting it properly. When I opened it to put in my frozen pizza, I was almost blinded by a bottle of broiled wine that was preparing to explode. I suggest that you divert some of the monies that you are pouring into the liquor industry.\u201d\n\n \u201cFor shame, Ignatius. A few bottles of Gallo muscatel, and you with all them trinkets.\u201d\n\n \u201cWill you please define the meaning of trinkets,\u201d Ignatius snapped.\n\n \u201cAll them books. That gramaphone. That trumpet I bought you last month.\u201d\n\n \u201cI consider the trumpet a good investment, although our neighbor, Miss Annie, does not. If she beats on my shutters again, I\u2019ll pour water on her.\u201d\n\n \u201cTomorrow we looking at the want ads in the paper. You gonna dress up and go find you a job.\u201d\n\n \u201cI am afraid to ask what your idea of \u2018dressing up\u2019 is. I will probably be turned into an utter mockery.\u201d\n\n \u201cI\u2019m gonna iron you a nice white shirt and you gonna put on one of your poppa\u2019s nice ties.\u201d\n\n \u201cDo I believe what I am hearing?\u201d Ignatius asked his pillow.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s either that, Ignatius, or I gotta take out a mortgage. You want to lose the roof over your head?\u201d\n\n \u201cNo! You will not mortgage this house.\u201d He pounded a great paw into the mattress.\n\n \u201cThe whole sense of security which I have been trying to develop would crumble. I will not have any disinterested party controlling my domicile. I couldn\u2019t stand it. Just the thought of it makes my hands break out.\u201d\n\n He extended a paw so that his mother could examine the rash.\n\n \u201cThat is out of the question,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt would bring all of my latent anxieties to a head, and the result, I fear, would be very ugly indeed. I would not want you to have to spend the remainder of your life caring for a lunatic locked away somewhere in the attic. We shall not mortgage the house. You must have some funds somewhere.\u201d\n\n \u201cI got a hundred fifty in the Hibernia Bank.\u201d\n\n \u201cMy God, is that all? I hardly thought that we were existing so precariously. However, it is fortunate that you have kept this from me. Had I known how close we were to total penury, my nerves would have given out long ago.\u201d Ignatius scratched his paws. \u201cI must admit, though, that the alternative for me is rather grim. I doubt very seriously whether anyone will hire me.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat do you mean, babe? You a fine boy with a good education.\u201d\n\n \u201cEmployers sense in me a denial of their values.\u201d He rolled over onto his back. \u201cThey fear me. I suspect that they can see that I am forced to function in a century which I loathe. That was true even when I worked for the New Orleans Public Library.\u201d\n\n \u201cBut, Ignatius, that was the only time you worked since you got out of college, and you was only there for two weeks.\u201d\n\n \u201cThat is exactly what I mean,\u201d Ignatius replied, aiming a paper ball at the bowl of the milk glass chandelier.\n\n \u201cAll you did was paste them little slips in the books.\u201d\n\n \u201cYes, but I had my own esthetic about pasting those slips. On some days I could only paste in three or four slips and at the same time feel satisfied with the quality of my work. The library authorities resented my integrity about the whole thing. They only wanted another animal who could slop glue on their best sellers.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou think maybe you could get a job there again?\u201d\n\n \u201cI seriously doubt it. At the time I said some rather cutting things to the woman in charge of the processing department. They even revoked my borrower\u2019s card. You must realize the fear and hatred which my weltanschauung instills in people.\u201d Ignatius belched.\n\n \u201cI won\u2019t mention that misguided trip to Baton Rouge. That incident, I believe, caused me to form a mental block against working.\u201d\n\n \u201cThey was nice to you at college, Ignatius. Now tell the truth. They let you hang around there a long time. They even let you teach a class.\u201d\n\n \u201cOh, it was basically the same. Some poor white from Mississippi told the dean that I was a propagandist for the Pope, which was patently untrue. I do not support the current Pope. He does not at all fit my concept of a good, authoritarian Pope. Actually, I am opposed to the relativism of modern Catholicism quite violently. However, the boldness of this ignorant lily-white redneck fundamentalist led my other students to form a committee to demand that I grade and return their accumulated essays and examinations. There was even a small demonstration outside the window of my office. It was rather dramatic. For being such simple, ignorant children, they managed it quite well. At the height of the demonstration I dumped all of the old papers -- ungraded, of course -- out of the window and right onto the students\u2019 heads. The college was too small to accept this act of defiance against the abyss of contemporary academia.\u201d\n\n \u201cIgnatius! You never told me that.\u201d\n\n \u201cI did not want to excite you at the time. I also told the students that, for the sake of humanity\u2019s future, I hoped that they were all sterile.\u201d Ignatius arranged the pillows about his head. \u201cI could never have possibly read over the illiteracies and misconceptions burbling from the dark minds of these students. It will be the same wherever I work.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou can get you a good job. Wait till they see a boy with a master\u2019s degree.\u201d\n\n Ignatius sighed heavily and said, \u201cI see no alternative.\u201d He twisted his face into a mask of suffering. There was no use fighting Fortuna until the cycle was over. \u201cYou realize, of course, that this is all your fault. The progress of my work will be greatly delayed. I suggest that you go to your confessor and make some penance, Mother. Promise him that you will avoid the path of sin and drinking in the future. Tell him what the consequence of your moral failure has been. Let him know that you have delayed the completion of a monumental indictment against our society. Perhaps he will comprehend the magnitude of your failing. If he is my type of priest, the penance will no doubt be rather strict. However, I have learned to expect little from today\u2019s clergyman.\u201d\n\n \u201cI\u2019m gonna be good, Ignatius. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n \u201cThere, there, I shall find some employment, although it will not necessarily be what you would call a good job. I may have some valuable insights which may benefit my employer. Perhaps the experience can give my writing a new dimension. Being actively engaged in the system which I criticize will be an interesting irony in itself.\u201d Ignatius belched loudly. \u201cIf only Myrna Minkoff could see how low I\u2019ve fallen.\u201d\n\n \u201cWhat that girl\u2019s doing now?\u201d Mrs. Reilly asked suspiciously. \u201cI put out good money for you to go to college, and you have to pick up with somebody like that.\u201d\n\n \u201cMyrna is still in New York, her native habitat. No doubt she is trying to taunt the police into arresting her in some demonstration at this very moment.\u201d\n\n \u201cShe sure used to get me nervous playing on that guitar of hers allover this house. If she\u2019s got money like you said, maybe you shoulda married her. You two might of settled\ndown and had a nice baby or something.\u201d\n\n \u201cDo I believe that such obscenity and filth is coming from the lips of my own mother?\u201d Ignatius bellowed. \u201cNow run along and fix me some dinner. I must be at the theater on time. It\u2019s a circus musical, a heralded excess which I have been waiting to see for some time. We study the want ads tomorrow.\u201d\n\n \u201cI\u2019m so proud you gonna work at last,\u201d Mrs. Reilly said emotionally and kissed her son somewhere in his damp moustache.", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 127850, "name": "John Kennedy Toole", "imageURL": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1700671341"}, "fullTitle": "A Confederacy of Dunces (Chap. 2.3) by John Kennedy Toole", "releaseDateComponents": null}, {"songID": 4707499, "lyrics": "\n[Verse 1]\nFeeling left out from the pack, you gotta go rogue\nFive\u200a years from now, will this even matter?

ain't simple-minded nigga, put your lies on the shelf\nCause you ain't satisfyin` me or your God damned self\nLet me give you for-instance with this kid named Chris\nWho used to say he fucked a bitch because she gave him a kiss\nStupid silly motherfucker with his crotch in his hand\nTellin` dirty bed stories to a full grown man\nI had to stop him in his tracks and had to put him in check\nCause he was gettin` out of hand and he was gettin` erect\nWent and bought the boy some pussy, nigga fucked it off\nGave the tramp a 20 spot, she gave the shit right back\nBut when he came out the room, I had to shut Chris up\nCause I'll be damned if he ain't tell me he and she ain't fucked\nYou a faggot if you stick your dick head in shit\nBut you a pussy if you sit and tell a lie on your dick\nSo check

had\nOr he claimed he had, and it's just too damn bad\nThat many brothers must resort to tellin` lies on Jim\nOver and over again, I've seen many of them\nTry to front like they be mackin`, Bushwick's the mack\nAnd any bitch that you'll attract will attest to that\nToo short for short fuckin`, just long and stiff\nAnd a pocket full of bullets for the niggas who riff\nYou a faggot if you stick your

He gave the speech in English on April 14, 1856, and it was published a few days later in the People's Paper. This was a Chartist paper, published in London from 1852 to 1858, for which Marx occasionally wrote articles.\n\n The so-called Revolutions of 1848 were but poor incidents-small fractures and fissures in the dry crust of European society. However, they denounced the abyss. Beneath the apparently solid surface, they betrayed oceans of liquid matter, only needing expansion to rend into fragments continents of hard rock. Noisily and confusedly they proclaimed the emancipation of the Proletarian, i.e., the secret of the nineteenth century, and of the revolution of that century. That social revolution, it is true, was no novelty invented in 1848. Steam, electricity, and the self-acting mule were revolutionists of a rather more dangerous character than even citizens Barb\u00e9s, Raspail and Blanqui. But, although the atmosphere in which we live, weighs upon every one with a 20,000 lb. force, do you feel it? No more than European society before 1848 felt the revolutionary atmosphere enveloping and pressing it from all sides. There is one great fact, characteristic of this our nineteenth century, a fact which no party dares deny. On the one hand, there have started into life industrial and scientific forces, which no epoch of the former human history had ever suspected. On the other hand, there exist symptoms of decay, far surpassing the horrors recorded of the latter times of the Roman empire. In our days everything seems pregnant with its contrary. Machinery, gifted with the wonderful power of shortening and fructifying human labour, we behold starving and overworking it. The new-fangled sources of wealth, by some strange weird spell, are turned into sources of want. The victories of art seem bought by the loss of character. At the same pace that mankind masters nature, man seems to become enslaved to other men or to his own infamy. Even the pure light of science seems unable to shine but on the dark background of ignorance. All our invention and progress seem to result in endowing material forces with intellectual life, and in stultifying human life into a material force. This antagonism between modern industry and science on the one hand, modern misery and dissolution on the other hand; this antagonism between the productive powers, and the social relations of our epoch is a fact, palpable, overwhelming, and not to be controverted. Some parties may wail over it; others may wish to get rid of modern arts, in order to get rid of modern conflicts. Or they may imagine that so signal a progress in industry wants to be completed by as signal a regress in politics. On our part, we do not mistake the shape of the shrewd spirit that continues to mark all these contradictions. We know that to work well the newfangled forces of society, they only want to be mastered by newfangled men-and such are the working men. They are as much the invention of modern time as machinery itself. In the signs that bewilder the middle class, the aristocracy and the poor prophets of regression, we do recognise our brave friend, Robin Goodfellow,1 the old mole that can work in the earth so fast, that worthy pioneer-the Revolution . The English working men are the first born sons of modern industry. They will then, certainly, not be the last in aiding the social revolution produced by that industry, a revolution, which means the emancipation of their own class all over the world, which is as universal as capital-rule and wages-slavery. I know the heroic struggles the English working class have gone through since the middle of the last century-struggles no less glorious, because they are shrouded in obscurity, and buried by the middle class historian. To revenge the misdeeds of the ruling class, there existed in the middle ages, in Germany, a secret tribunal, called the \"Vehmgericht.\" If a red cross was seen marked on a house, people knew that its owner was doomed by the \"Vehm.\" All the houses of Europe are now marked with the mysterious red cross. History is the judge-its executioner, the proletarian.\n\n Working-Class Manchester\n\n FRIEDRICH ENGELS\n\nEngels, the son of a well-to-do German manufacturer, was sent to England in 1842, at the age of twenty-two, to learn business In the office of the Ermen and Engels paper mill in the industrial city of Manchester He remained in England for nearly two years and while there gathered material for his first book, The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, which was published in German in 1845. The extract below, from the chapter on \"The Great Towns,\" is taken from the English translation published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House, Moscow, in 1962.\n\n * * * I now proceed to describe Manchester's worker districts. First of all, there is the Old Town, which lies between the northern boundary of the commercial district and the Irk. Here the streets, even the better ones, are narrow and winding, as Todd Street, Long Millgate, Withy Grove, and Shude Hill, the houses dirty, old, and tumble-down, and the construction of the side streets utterly horrible. Going from the Old Church to Long Millgate, the stroller has at once a row of old-fashioned houses at the right, of which not one has kept its original level; these are remnants of the old pre-manufacturing Manchester, whose former inhabitants have removed with their descendants into better-built districts, and have left the houses, which were not good enough for them, to a working-class population strongly mixed with Irish blood. Here one is in an almost undisguised working-men's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble to exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness. But all this is nothing in comparison with the courts and lanes which lie behind, to which access can be gained only through covered passages, in which no two human beings can pass at the same time. Of the irregular cramming together of dwellings in ways which defy all rational plan, of the tangle in which they are crowded literally one upon the other, it is impossible to convey an idea. And it is not the buildings surviving from the old times of Manchester which are to blame for this; the confusion has only recently reached its height when every scrap of space left by the old way of building has been filled up and patched over until not a foot of land is left to be further occupied.\n\n To confirm my statement I have drawn here a small section of the plan of Manchester-not the worst spot and not one-tenth of the whole Old Town.\n\n This drawing will suffice to characterise the irrational manner in which the entire district was built, particularly the part near the Irk.\n\n The south bank of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and thirty feet high. On this declivitous hillside there are planted three rows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while the front walls of the highest stand on the crest of the hill in Long Millgate. Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of construction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of Long Millgate. Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from the main street into numerous courts, and he who turns in thither gets into a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not be found-especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which contain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet beheld. In one of these\n\nINSERT IMAGE\ncourts there stands directly at the entrance, at the end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the inhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through foul pools of stagnant urine and excrement. This is the first court on the Irk above Ducie Bridge in case any one should care to look into it. Below it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole neighborhood with the stench of animal putrefaction. Below Ducie Bridge the only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty stairs and over heaps of refuse and filth. The first court below Ducie Bridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the cholera that the sanitary police ordered it evacuated, swept and disinfected with chloride of lime. Dr. Kay gives a terrible description of the state of this court at that time.1 Since then, it seems to have been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from Ducie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of d\u00e9bris with some newer houses . The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed from mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is characteristic for the whole district. At the bottom flows, or rather stagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of d\u00e9bris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank. In dry weather, a long string of the most disgusting blackish-green slime pools are left standing on this bank, from the depths of which bubbles of miasmatic gas constantly arise and give forth a stench unendurable even on the bridge forty or fifty feet above the surface of the stream. But besides this, the stream itself is checked every few paces by high weirs, behind which slime and refuse accumulate and rot in thick masses. Above the bridge are tanneries, bonemills, and gasworks, from which all drains and refuse find their way into the Irk, which receives further the contents of all the neighbouring sewers and privies. It may be easily imagined, therefore, what sort of residue the stream deposits. Below the bridge you look upon the piles of d\u00e9bris, the refuse, filth, and offal from the courts on the steep left bank; here each house is packed close behind its neighbour and a piece of each is visible, all black, smoky, crumbling, ancient, with broken panes and window-frames. The background is furnished by old barrack-like factory buildings. On the lower right bank stands a long row of houses and mills; the second house being a ruin without a roof, piled with d\u00e9bris ; the third stands so low that the lowest floor is uninhabitable, and therefore without windows or doors. Here the background embraces the pauper burial-ground, the station of the Liverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the rear of this, the Workhouse, the \"Poor-Law Bastille\" of Manchester, which, like a citadel, looks threateningly down from behind its high walls and parapets on the hilltop, upon the working-people's quarter below.\n\n Above Ducie Bridge, the left bank grows more flat and the right bank steeper, but the condition of the dwellings on both banks grows worse rather than better. He who turns to the left here from the main street, Long Millgate, is lost; he wanders from one court to another, turns countless corners, passes nothing but narrow, filthy nooks and alleys, until after a few minutes he has lost all clue, and knows not whither to turn. Everywhere half or wholly ruined buildings, some of them actually uninhabited, which means a great deal here; rarely a wooden or stone floor to be seen in the houses, almost uniformly broken, ill-fitting windows and doors, and a state of filth! Everywhere heaps of d\u00e9bris, refuse, and offal; standing pools for gutters, and a stench which alone would make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to live in such a district. The newly-built extension of the Leeds railway, which crosses the Irk here, has swept away some of these courts and lanes, laying others completely open to view. Immediately under the railway bridge there stands a court, the filth and horrors of which surpass all the others by far, just because it was hitherto so shut off, so secluded that the way to it could not be found without a good deal of trouble. I should never have discovered it myself, without the breaks made by the railway, though I thought I knew this whole region thoroughly. Passing along a rough bank, among stakes and washinglines, one penetrates into this chaos of small one-storied, oneroomed huts, in most of which there is no artificial floor; kitchen, living and sleeping-room all in one. In such a hole, scarcely five feet long by six broad, I found two beds-and such bedsteads and beds! -which, with a staircase and chimney-place, exactly filled the room. In several others I found absolutely nothing, while the door stood open, and the inhabitants leaned against it. Everywhere before the doors refuse and offal; that any sort of pavement lay underneath could not be seen but only felt, here and there, with the feet. This whole collection of cattle-sheds for human beings was surrounded on two sides by houses and a factory, and on the third by the river, and besides the narrow stair up the bank, a narrow doorway alone led out into another almost equally ill-built, ill-kept labyrinth of dwellings.\n\n Enough! The whole side of the Irk is built in this way, a planless, knotted chaos of houses, more or less on the verge of uninhabitableness, whose unclean interiors fully correspond with their filthy external surroundings. And how could the people be clean with no proper opportunity for satisfying the most natural and ordinary wants? Privies are so rare here that they are either filled up every day, or are too remote for most of the inhabitants to use. How can people wash when they have only the dirty Irk water at hand, while pumps and water pipes can be found in decent parts of the city alone? In truth, it cannot be charged to the account of these helots of modern society if their dwellings are not more clean than the pig sties which are here and there to be seen among them. The landlords are not ashamed to let dwellings like the six or seven cellars on the quay directly below Scotland Bridge, the floors of which stand at least two feet below the low-water level of the Irk that flows not six feet away from them; or like the upper floor of the corner-house on the opposite shore directly above the bridge, where the ground-floor, utterly uninhabitable, stands deprived of all fittings for doors and windows, a case by no means rare in this region, when this open ground-floor is used as a privy by the whole neighbourhood for want of other facilities!\n\n If we leave the Irk and penetrate once more on the opposite side from Long Millgate into the midst of the working-men's dwellings, we shall come into a somewhat newer quarter, which stretches from St. Michael's Church to Withy Grove and Shude Hill. Here there is somewhat better order. In place of the chaos of buildings, we find at least long straight lanes and alleys or courts, built according to a plan and usually square. But if, in the former case, every house was built according to caprice, here each lane and court is so built, without reference to the situation of the adjoining ones. The lanes run now in this direction, now in that, while every two minutes the wanderer gets into a blind alley, or on turning a corner, finds himself back where he started from; certainly no one who has not lived a considerable time in this labyrinth can find his way through it.\n\n If I may use the word at all in speaking of this district, the ventilation of these streets and courts is, in consequence of this confusion, quite as imperfect as in the Irk region; and if this quarter may, nevertheless, be said to have some advantage over that of the Irk, the houses being newer and the streets occasionally having gutters, nearly every house has, on the other hand, a cellar dwelling, which is rarely found in .the Irk district, by reason of the greater age and more careless construction of the houses. As for the rest, the filth, d\u00e9bris, and offal heaps, and the pools ,in the streets are common to both quarters, and in the district now under discussion, another feature most injurious to the cleanliness of the inhabitants, is the multitude of pigs walking about in all the alleys, rooting into the offal heaps, or kept imprisoned in small pens. Here, as in most of the working-men's quarters of Manchester, the pork-raisers rent the courts and build pig-pens in them. In almost every court one or even several such pens may be found, into which the inhabitants of the court throw all refuse, and offal, whence the swine grow fat; and the atmosphere, confined on all four sides, is utterly corrupted by putrefying animal and vegetable substances. Through this quarter, a broad and measurably decent street has been cut, Millers Street, and the background has been pretty successfully concealed. But if any one should be led by curiosity to pass through one of the numerous passages which lead into the courts, he will find this piggery repeated at every twenty paces.\n\n Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I am forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this single district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants. And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England, the first manufacturing city of the world. If any one wishes to see in how little space a human being can move, how little air-and such air!-he can breathe, how little of civilisation he may share and yet live, it is only necessary to travel hither. True, this is the Old Town, and the people of Manchester emphasise the fact whenever any one mentions to them the frightful condition of this Hell upon Earth; but what does that prove? Everything which here arouses horror and indignation is of recent origin, belongs to the industrial epoch. The couple of hundred houses, which belong to old Manchester, have been long since abandoned by their original inhabitants; the industrial epoch alone has crammed into them the swarms of workers whom they now shelter; the industrial epoch alone has built up every spot between these old houses to win a covering for the masses whom it has conjured hither from the agricultural districts and from Ireland; the industrial epoch alone enables the owners of these cattlesheds to rent them for high prices to human beings, to plunder the poverty of the workers, to undermine the health of thousands, in order that they alone, the owners, may grow rich. In the industrial epoch alone has it become possible that the worker scarcely freed from feudal servitude could be used as mere material, a mere chattel; that he must let himself be crowded into a dwelling too bad for every other, which he for his hard-earned wages buys the right to let go utterly to ruin. This manufacture has achieved, which, without these workers, this poverty, this slavery could not have lived. True, the original construction of this quarter was bad, little good could have been made out of it; but, have the landowners, has the municipality done anything to improve it when rebuilding? On the contrary, wherever a nook or comer was free, a house has been run up; where a superfluous passage remained, it has been built up; the value of land rose with the blossoming out of manufacture, and the more it rose, the more madly was the work of building up carried on, without reference to the health or comfort of the inhabitants, with sole reference to the highest possible profit on the principle that no hole is so bad but that some poor creature must take it who can pay for nothing better. However, it is the Old Town, and with this reflection the bourgeoisie is comforted. Let us see, therefore, how much better it is in the New Town.\n\n The New Town, known also as lrish Town, stretches up a hill of clay, beyond the Old Town, between the Irk and St. George's Road. Here all the features of a city are lost. Single rows of houses or groups of sheets stand, here and there, like little villages on the naked, not even grassgrown clay soil; the houses, or rather cottages, are in bad order, never repaired, filthy, with damp, unclean, cellar dwellings; the lanes are neither paved nor supplied with sewers, but harbour numerous colonies of swine penned in small sties or yards, or wandering unrestrained through the neighbourhood. The mud in the streets is so deep that there is never a chance, except in the dryest weather, of walking without sinking into it ankle deep at every step. In the vicinity of St. George' s Road, the separate groups of buildings approach each other more closely, ending in a continuation of lines, blind alleys, back lanes and courts, which grow more and more crowded and irregular the nearer they approach the heart of the town. True, they are here oftener paved or supplied with paved sidewalks and gutters; but the filth, the bad odor of the houses, and especially of the cellars, remain the same.\n\n * * *\n\n The Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850\n\n KARL MARX\n\nFrance opened the round of revolutions of 1848 in Europe.* The Parisian workers figured importantly in the French revolutionary events from their opening in February, when King Louis Philippe was forced to abdicate, through the June workers' insurrection, which was suppressed with great ferocity by General Cavaignac's forces. Later, the national election of December 10, 1848, brought to the French Republic's presidency Napoleon's nephew, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who in 1851 made himself emperor by coup d'\u00e9tat.\n.\n In this most mordantly brilliant of his revolutionary pamphlets, first published in 1850 as a series of articles in Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Marx not only coined such well-known phrases as \"Revolutions are the locomotives of history\"; he portrayed the French workers' action as the debut of a coming Europe-wide proletarian revolution, and interspersed his narrative of France's 1848 revolution with passages of broader import that illuminate key points in his thought. These passages have been gathered together in the selection presented here.**\n\n With the exception of only a few chapters, every more important part of the annals of the revolution from 1848 to 1849 carries the heading: Defeat of the revolution!\n What succumbed in these defeats was not the revolution. It was the pre-revolutionary traditional appendages, results of social relationships which had not yet come to the point of sharp class antagonisms-persons, illusions, conceptions, projects from which the revolutionary party before the February Revolution was not free, from which it could be freed not by the victory of February, but only by a series of defeats.\n\n In a word: the revolution made progress, forged ahead, not by its immediate tragicomic achievements, but on the contrary by the creation of a powerful, united counter-revolution, by the creation of an opponent in combat with whom, only, the party of overthrow ripened into a really revolutionary party.\n\n To prove this is the task of the following pages.\n\n * * *\n\n The Provisional Government which emerged from the February barricades necessarily mirrored in its composition the different parties which shared in the victory. It could not be anything but a compromise between the different classes which together had overturned the July throne, but whose interests were mutually antagonistic. The great majority of its members consisted of representatives of the bourgeoisie. The republican petty bourgeoisie was represented by Ledru-Rollin and Flocon, the republican bourgeoisie by the people from the National,1 the dynastic opposition by Cr\u00e9mieux, Dupont de l'Eure, etc. The working class had only two representatives, Louis Blanc and Albert. Finally, Lamartine in the Provisional Government, this was at first no real interest, no definite class; this was the February Revolution itself, the common uprising with its illusions, its poetry, its visionary content and its phrases. For the rest, the spokesman of the February Revolution, by his position and his views, belonged to the bourgeoisie.\n\n If Paris, as a result of political centralisation, rules France, the workers, in moments of revolutionary earthquakes, rule Paris. The first act in the life of the Provisional Government was an attempt to escape from this overpowering influence by an appeal from intoxicated Paris to sober France. Lamartine disputed the right of the barricade fighters to proclaim a republic on the ground that only the majority of Frenchmen had that right; they must await their votes, the Paris proletariat must not besmirch its victory by a usurpation. The bourgeoisie allows the proletariat only one usurpation-that of fighting.\n\n * * *\n\n Even the memory of the limited aims and motives which drove the bourgeoisie into the February Revolution was extinguished by the proclamation of the republic on the basis of universal suffrage. Instead of only a few factions of the bourgeoisie, all classes of French society were suddenly hurled into the orbit of political power, forced to leave the boxes, the stalls and the gallery and to act in person upon the revolutionary stage! With the constitutional monarchy vanished also the semblance of a state power independently confronting bourgeois society as well as the whole series of subordinate struggles which this semblance of power called forth!\n\n By dictating the republic to the Provisional Government and through the Provisional Government to the whole of France, the proletariat stepped into the foreground forthwith as an independent party, but at the same time challenged the whole of bourgeois France to enter the lists against it. What it won was the terrain for the fight for its revolutionary emancipation, but by no means this emancipation itself.\n\n In common with the bourgeoisie the workers had made the February Revolution, and alongside the bourgeoisie they sought to secure the advancement of their interest, just as they had installed a worker in the Provisional Government itself alongside the bourgeois majority. Organise labour! But wage labour, that is the existing, the bourgeois organisation of labour. Without it there is no capital, no bourgeoisie, no bourgeois society. A Special Ministry of Labour! But the Ministries of Finance, of Trade, of Public Works-are not these the bourgeois Ministries of Labour? And alongside these a proletarian Ministry of Labour had to be a ministry of impotence, a ministry of pious wishes, a Luxembourg Commission. Just as the workers thought they would be able to emancipate themselves side by side with the bourgeoisie, so they thought they would be able to\nconsummate a proletarian revolution within the national walls of France, side by side with the remaining bourgeois nations. But French relations of production are conditioned by the foreign trade of France, by her position on the world market and the laws thereof; how was France to break them without a European revolutionary war, which would strike back at the despot of the world market, England?\n\n As soon as it has risen up, a class in which the revolutionary interests of society are concentrated finds the content and the material for its revolutionary activity directly in its own situation: foes to be laid low, measures dictated by the needs of the struggle to be taken; the consequences of its own deeds drive it on. It makes no theoretical inquiries into its own task. The French working class had not attained this level; it was still incapable of accomplishing its own revolution.\n\n The development of the industrial proletariat is, in general, conditioned by the development of the industrial bourgeoisie. Only under its rule does the proletariat gain that extensive national existence which can raise its revolution to a national one, and does it itself create the modern means of production, which become just so many means of its revolutionary emancipation. Only its rule tears up the material roots of feudal society and levels the ground on which alone a proletarian revolution is possible. French industry is more developed and the French bourgeoisie more revolutionary than that of the rest of the Continent. But was not the February Revolution levelled directly against the finance aristocracy? This fact proved that the industrial bourgeoisie did not rule France. The industrial bourgeoisie can rule only where modern industry shapes all property relations to suit itself, and industry can win this power only where it has conquered the world market, for national bounds are inadequate for its development. But French industry, to a great extent, maintains its command even of the national market only through a more or less modified system of prohibitive duties. While, therefore, the French proletariat, at the moment of a revolution, possesses in Paris actual power and influence which spur it on to a drive beyond its means, in the rest of France it is crowded into separate, scattered industrial centres, being almost lost in the superior numbers of peasants and petty bourgeois. The struggle against capital in its developed, modern form, in its decisive aspect, the struggle of the industrial wage worker against the industrial bourgeois, is in France a partial phenomenon, which after the February days could so much the less supply the national content of the revolution, since the struggle against capital's secondary modes of exploitation, that of the peasant against usury and mortgages or of the petty bourgeois against the wholesale dealer, banker and manufacturer, in a word, against bankruptcy, was still hidden in the general uprising against the finance aristocracy.\n\n * * *\n Thus in the approaching m\u00eal\u00e9e between bourgeoisie and proletariat, all the advantages, all the decisive posts, all the middle strata of society were in the hands of the bourgeoisie, at the same time as the waves of the February Revolution rose high over the whole Continent and each new post brought a new bulletin of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest parts of South Eastern Europe, and maintained the general ecstasy of the people, giving it constant testimony of a victory that it had already forfeited.\n\n * * *\n\n The workers were left no choice; they had to starve or let fly. They answered on June 22 with the tremendous insurrection in which the first great battle was fought between the two classes that split modern society. It was a fight for the preservation or annihilation of the bourgeois order. The veil that shrouded the republic was torn asunder.\n\n It is well known how the workers, with unexampled bravery and ingenuity, without leaders, without a common plan, without means and, for the most part, lacking weapons, held in check for five days the army, the Mobile Guard, the Paris National Guard and the National Guard that streamed in from the provinces. It is well known how the bourgeoisie compensated itself for the mortal anguish it suffered by unheard of brutality, massacring over 3,000 prisoners.\n\n * * *\n\n The official representatives of French democracy were steeped in republican ideology to such an extent that it was only some weeks later that they began to have an inkling of the significance of the June fight. They were stupefied by the gunpower smoke in which their fantastic republic dissolved.\n\n The Paris proletariat was forced into the June insurrection by the bourgeoisie. This sufficed to mark its doom. Its immediate, avowed needs did not drive it to engage in a light for the forcible overthrow of the bourgeoisie, nor was it equal to this task. The Moniteur had to inform it officially that the time was past when the republic saw any occasion to bow and scrape to its illusions, and only its defeat convinced it of the truth that the slightest improvement in its position remains a utopia within the bourgeois republic, a utopia that becomes a crime as soon as it wants to become a reality. In place of its demands, exuberant in form, but petty and even bourgeois still in content, the concession of which it wanted to wring from the February republic, there appeared the bold slogan of revolutionary struggle: Overthrow of the bourgeoisie! Dictatorship of the working class!\n\n By making its burial place the birthplace of the bourgeois republic, the proletariat compelled the latter to come out forthwith in its pure form as the state whose admitted object it is to perpetuate the rule of capital, the slavery of labour. Having constantly before its eyes the scarred, irreconcilable, invincible enemy-invincible because his existence is the condition of its own life-bourgeois rule, freed from all fetters, was bound to turn immediately into bourgeois terrorism. With the proletariat removed for the time being from the stage and bourgeois dictatorship recognised officially, the middle strata of bourgeois society, the petty bourgeoisie and the peasant class, had to adhere more and more closely to the proletariat as their position became more unbearable and their antagonism to the bourgeoisie more acute. Just as earlier they had to find the cause of their distress in its upsurge, so now in its defeat.\n\n If the June insurrection raised the self-assurance of the bourgeoisie all over the Continent, and caused it to league itself openly with the feudal monarchy against the people, who was the first victim of this alliance? The Continental bourgeoisie itself. The June defeat prevented it from consolidating its rule and from bringing the people, half satisfied and half out of humour, to a standstill at the lowest stage of the bourgeois revolution.\n\n Finally, the defeat of June divulged to the despotic powers of Europe the secret that France must maintain peace abroad at any price in order to be able to wage civil war at home. Thus the peoples who had begun the fight for their national independence were abandoned to the superior power of Russia, Austria and Prussia, but, at the same time, the fate of these national revolutions was made subject to the fate of the proletarian revolution, and they were robbed of their apparent autonomy, their independence of the great social revolution. The Hungarian shall not be free, nor the Pole, nor the Italian, as long as the worker remains a slave!\n\n Finally, with the victories of the Holy Alliance, Europe has taken on a form that makes every fresh proletarian upheaval in France directly coincide with a world war. The new French revolution is forced to leave its national soil forthwith and conquer the European terrain, on which alone the social revolution of the nineteenth century can be accomplished.\n\n Thus only the June defeat has created all the conditions under which France can seize the initiative of the European revolution. Only after being dipped in the blood of the June insurgents did the tricolour become the flag of the European revolution-the red flag!\n\n And we exclaim: The revolution is dead!-Long live the revolution!\n\n * * *\n\n December 10, 1848, was the day of the peasant insurrection.2 Only from this day does the February of the French peasants date. The symbol that expressed their entry into the revolutionary movement, clumsily cunning, knavishly naive, doltishly sublime, a calculated superstition, a pathetic burlesque, a cleverly stupid anachronism, a world-historic piece of buffoonery and an undecipherable hieroglyphic for the understanding of the civilised-this symbol bore the unmistakable physiognomy of the class that represents barbarism within civilisation. The republic had announced itself to this class with the tax collector; it announced itself to the republic with the emperor. Napoleon was the only man who had exhaustively represented the interests and the imagination of the peasant class, newly created in 1789. By writing his name on the frontispiece of the republic, it declared war abroad and the enforcing of its class interests at home. Napoleon was to the peasants not a person but a programme. With banners, with beat of drums and blare of trumpets, they marched to the polling booths shouting: plus d'imp\u00f4ts, \u00e0 bas les riches, \u00e0 bas la r\u00e9publique, vive l'Empereur! No more taxes, down with the rich, down with the republic, long live the emperor! Behind the emperor was hidden the peasant war. The republic that they voted down was the republic of the rich.\n\n December 10 was the coup d'etat of the peasants, which overthrew the existing government. And from that day on, when they had taken a government from France and given a government to her, their eyes were fixed steadily on Paris. For a moment active heroes of the revolutionary drama, they could no longer be forced back into the inactive and spineless role of the chorus.\n\n * * *\n\n In France, the petty bourgeois does what normally the industrial bourgeois would have to do; the worker does what normally would be the task of the petty bourgeois; and the task of the worker, who accomplishes that? No one. In France it is not accomplished; in France it is proclaimed. It is not accomplished anywhere within the national walls; the class war within French society turns into a world war, in which the nations confront one another. Accomplishment begins only at the moment when, through the world war, the proletariat is pushed to the van of the people that dominates the world market, to the van of England. The revolution, which finds here not its end, but its organisational beginning is no shortlived revolution. The present generation is like the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It has not only a new world to conquer, it must go under in order to make room for the men who are able to cope with a new world.\n\n * * *\n\n So swiftly had the march of the revolution ripened conditions that the friends of reform of all shades, the most moderate claims of the middle classes, were compelled to group themselves round the banner of the most extreme party of revolution, round the red flag.\n\n * * *\n\n *** Since it 3 dreams of the peaceful achievement of its socialism-allowing, perhaps, for a second February Revolution lasting a brief day or so-the coming historical process naturally appears to it as an application of systems, which the thinkers of society, whether in companies or as individual inventors, devise or have devised. Thus they become the eclectics or adepts of the existing socialist systems, of doctrinaire socialism, which was the theoretical expression of the proletariat only as long as it had not yet developed further into a free historical movement of its own.\n\n While this utopia, doctrinaire socialism, which subordinates the total movement to one of its moments, which puts in place of common, social production the brainwork of individual pedants and, above all, in fantasy does away with the revolutionary struggle of the classes and its requirements by small conjurers' tricks or great sentimentality; while this doctrinaire socialism, which at bottom only idealises present society, takes a picture of it without shadows and wants to achieve its ideal athwart the realities of present society; while the proletariat surrenders this socialism to the petty bourgeoisie; while the struggle of the different socialist leaders among themselves sets forth each of the so-called systems as a pretentious adherence to one of the transit points of the social revolution as against another-the proletariat rallies more and more round revolutionary socialism, round communism, for which the bourgeoisie has itself invented the name of Blanqui. This socialism is the declaration of the permanence of the revolution, the class dictatorship of the proletariat as the necessary transit point to the abolition of class distinctions generally, to the abolition of all the relations of production on which they rest, to the abolition of all the social relations that correspond to these relations of production, to the revolutionising of all the ideas that result from these social relations.\n\n The scope of this exposition does not permit of developing the subject further.\n\n * * *\n\n Just as the period of crisis occurs later on the Continent than in England, so does that of prosperity. The original process always takes place in England; it is the demiurge of the bourgeois cosmos. On the Continent, the different phases of the cycle through which bourgeois society is ever speeding anew occur in secondary and tertiary form. First, the Continent exported incomparably more to England than to any other country. This export to England, however, in turn depends on the position of England, particularly with regard to the overseas market. Then England exports to the overseas lands incomparably more than the entire Continent, so that the quantity of Continental exports to these lands is always dependent on England's overseas exports at the time. While, therefore, the crises first produce revolutions on the Continent, the foundation for these is, nevertheless, always laid in England. Violent outbreaks must naturally occur rather in the extremities of the bourgeois body than in its heart, since the possibility of adjustment is greater here than there. On the other hand, the degree to which the Continental revolutions react on England is at the same time the barometer which indicates how far these revolutions really call in question the bourgeois conditions of life, or how far they only hit their political formations.\n\n With this general prosperity, in which the productive forces of bourgeois society develop as luxuriantly as is at all possible within bourgeois relationships, there can be no talk of a real revolution. Such a revolution is only possible in the periods when both these factors, the modern productive forces and the bourgeois productive forms come in collision with each other. The various quarrels in which the representatives of the individual factions of the Continental party of Order now indulge and mutually compromise themselves, far from providing the occasion for new revolutions are, on the contrary, possible only because the basis of the relationships is momentarily so secure and, what the reaction does not know, so bourgeois. From it all attempts of the reaction to hold up bourgeois development will rebound just as certainly as all moral indignation and all enthusiastic proclamations of the democrats. A new revolution is possible only in consequence of a new crisis. It is, however, just as certain as this crisis.\n\n * * *\n\n The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\n\n KARL MARX\n\nThis pamphlet, a stylistic masterpiece, shows Marx in his most brilliant form as a social and political historian, treating actual historical events those leading up to Louis Bonaparte's coup d'etat of December 2, 1851-from the viewpoint of the materialist conception of history. In a preface to the second edition, he himself said it was the intention of the work to \"demonstrate how the class struggle in France created circumstances and relationships that made it possible for a grotesque mediocrity to play a hero's part.\" Since Louis Bonaparte's rise and rule have been seen as a forerunner of the phenomenon that was to become known in the twentieth century as fascism, Marx's interpretation of it is of interest, among other ways, as a sort of prologue to later Marxist thought on the nature and meaning of fascism.\n\n The Eighteenth Brumaire was written by Marx in late 1851 and early 1852, and originally appeared in 1 8 52 in a magazine entitled Die Revolution, published in New York. The most important sections-the first and the last-appear here.\n\n I\n\n Hegel remarks somewhere that all great, world-historical facts and personages occur, as it were, twice. He has forgotten to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Caussidi\u00e8re for Danton Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Mountain of 1848 to 1851 -for the Mountain of 1793 to 1795, the Nephew for the Uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances in which the second edition of the Eighteenth Brumaire is taking place.1\n\n Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living. And just when they seem engaged in revolutionising themselves and things, in creating something entirely new, precisely in such epochs of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle slogans and costumes in order to present the new scene of world history in this time-honoured disguise and this borrowed language. Thus Luther donned the mask of the Apostle Paul, the Revolution of 1789 to 1814 draped itself alternately as the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and the Revolution of 184 8 knew nothing better to do than to parody, in turn, 1789 and the revolutionary tradition of 1793 to 1795. In like manner the beginner who has learnt a new language always translates it back into his mother tongue, but he has assimilated the spirit of the new language and can produce freely in it only when he moves in it without remembering the old and forgets in it his ancestral tongue.\n\n Consideration of this world-historical conjuring up of the dead reveals at once a salient difference. Camille Desmoulins; Danton, Robespierre, Saint-Just, Napoleon, the heroes, as well as the parties and the masses o f the old French Revolution, performed the task of their time in Roman costume and with Roman phrases, the task of releasing and setting up modern bourgeois society. The first ones knocked the feudal basis to pieces and mowed off the feudal heads which had grown from it. The other created inside France the conditions under which free competition could first be developed, the parcelled landed property exploited, the unfettered productive power of the nation employed, and outside the French borders he everywhere swept the feudal formations away, so far as was necessary to furnish bourgeois society in France with\u2022 a suitable up-to-date environment on the European Continent. The new social formation once established, the antediluvian Colossi disappeared and with them the resurrected Romans-the Brutuses, Gracchi, Publicolas, the tribunes, the senators and Caesar himself. Bourgeois society in its sober reality had begotten its true interpreters and mouthpieces in the Says, Cousins, Royer-Collards, Benjamin Constants and Guizots; its real military leaders sat behind the office desks, and the hogheaded Louis XVIII was its political chief. Wholly absorbed in the production of wealth and in the peaceful struggle of competition, it no longer comprehended that ghosts from the days of Rome had watched over its cradle. But unheroic as bourgeois society is, yet it had need of heroism, of sacrifice, of terror, of civil war and of national battles to bring it into being. And in the classically austere traditions of the Roman Republic its gladiators found the ideals and the art forms, the self-deceptions that they needed in order to conceal from themselves the bourgeois limitations of the content of their struggles and to keep their passion at the height of the great historical tragedy. Similarly, at another stage of development, a century earlier, Cromwell and the English people had borrowed speech, passions and illusions from the Old Testament for their bourgeois revolution.2 When the real aim had been achieved, when the bourgeois transformation of English society had been accomplished, Locke supplanted Habakkuk.\n\n The awakening of the dead in those revolutions therefore served the purpose of glorifying the new struggles, not of parodying the old; of magnifying the given tasks in imagination, not of taking flight from their solution in reality; of finding once more the spirit of revolution, not of making its ghost walk again.\n\n From 1848 to 1851 only the ghost of the old revolution walked, from Marrast, the republicain en gants jaunes,3 who disguised himself as the old Bailly, to the adventurer who hides his trivially repulsive features under the iron death mask of Napoleon. An entire people, which had imagined that by a revolution it had increased its power of action, suddenly finds itself set back into a dead epoch and, in order that no doubt as to the relapse may be possible, the old data again arise, the old chronology, the old names, the old edicts, which have long become a subject of antiquarian erudition, and the old henchmen, who had long seemed dead and decayed. The nation appears to itself like that mad Englishman in Bedlam, who fancies that he lives in the times of the ancient Pharaohs and daily bemoans the hard labour that he must perform in the Ethiopian mines as a gold digger, immured in this subterranean prison, a dimly burning lamp fastened to his head, the overseer of the slaves behind him with a long whip, and at the exits a confused mass of barbarian mercenaries, who understand neither the forced labourers in the mines nor one another, since they have no common speech. \"And all this is expected of me,\" groans the mad Englishman, \"of me, a free-born Briton, in order to make gold -for the old Pharaohs.\" \"In order to pay the debts of the Bonaparte family,\" sighs the French nation. The Englishman, so long as he was in his right mind, could not get rid of the fixed idea of making gold. The French, so long as they were engaged in revolution, could not get rid of the memory of Napoleon, as the election of December 10, 1848,4 proved. From the perils of revolution their longings went back to the flesh-pots of Egypt, and December 2, 1851, was the answer. They have not only a caricature of the old Napoleon, they have the old Napoleon himself, caricatured as he would inevitably appear in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\n The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot draw its poetry from the past, but only from the future. It cannot begin with itself, before it has stripped off all superstition in regard to the past. Earlier revolutions required world-historical recollections in order to drug themselves concerning their own content. In order to arrive at its content, the revolution of the nineteenth century must let the dead bury their dead. There the phrase went beyond the content; here the content goes beyond the phrase.\n\n The February Revolution was a sudden attack, a taking of the old society by surprise, and the people proclaimed this unhoped for stroke as a world-historic deed, opening the new epoch. On December 2 the February Revolution is conjured away by a card-sharper's trick, and what seems overthrown is no longer the monarchy; it is the liberal concessions that were wrung from it by century-long struggles. Instead of society having conquered a new content for itself, the state only appears to have returned to its oldest form, to the shamelessly simple domination of the sabre and the cowl. This is the answer to the coup de main of February 1848, given by the coup de t\u00eate of December 1851. Easy come, easy go. Meanwhile the interval has not passed by unused. During the years 1848 to 1851 French society has made up, and that by an abbreviated, because revolutionary, method, for the studies and experiences which, in a regular, so to speak, text-book development would have had to precede the February Revolution, if the latter was to be more than a disturbance of the surface. Society now seems to have fallen back behind its point o f departure; it has in truth first to create for itself the revolutionary point of departure, the situation, the relationships, the conditions, under which modern revolution alone becomes serious.\n\n Bourgeois revolutions, like those of the eighteenth century, storm more swiftly from success to success; their dramatic effects outdo each other; men and things seem set in sparkling brilliants; ecstasy is the everyday spirit: but they are short lived; soon they have attained their zenith, and a long depression lays hold of society before it learns soberly to assimilate the results of its storm and stress period. Proletarian revolutions, on the other hand, like those of the nineteenth century, criticise themselves constantly, interrupt themselves continually in their own course, come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh, deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies, weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts, seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them, recoil ever and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims, until the situation has been created which makes all turning back impossible, and the conditions themselves cry out:\n\n Hic Rhodus, hic salta!\n Hier ist die Rose, hier tanze!5\n\n For the rest, every fairly competent observer, even if he had not followed the course of French development step by step, must have had a presentiment that a terrible fiasco was in store for the revolution. It was enough to hear the self-complacent howl of victory with which Messieurs the Democrats congratulated each other on the gracious consequences of May 2, 1852.6 In their minds May 2, 1852, had become a fixed idea, a dogma, like the day on which Christ should reappear and the millennium begin, in the minds of the Chiliasts.7 As ever, weakness had taken refuge in a belief in miracles, had fancied the enemy overcome when he was only conjured away in imagination, and lost all understanding of the present in a passive glorification of the future that was in store for it and of the deeds it had in petto,8 but merely did not want to carry out as yet. Those heroes, who seek to disprove their demonstrated incapacity by mutually offering each other their sympathy and getting together in a crowd, had tied up their bundles, collected their laurel wreaths in advance and were just then engaged in discounting on the exchange market the republics in partibus,9 for which they had already thoughtfully organised the government personnel with all the calm of their unassuming disposition . December 2 struck them like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and the peoples that in epochs of pusillanimous depression gladly let their inward apprehension be drowned by the loudest bawlers will perchance have convinced themselves that the times are past when the cackle of geese could save the Capitol.1\n\n The Constitution, the National Assembly, the dynastic parties,2 the blue and the red republicans,3 the heroes of Africa,4 the thunder from the platform, the sheet lightning of the daily press, the entire literature, the political names and the intellectual reputations, the civil law and penal code, the libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9 and the second of May 1852-all have vanished like a phantasmagoria before the spell of a man whom even his enemies do not make out to be a magician. Universal suffrage seems to have survived only for a moment, in order that with its own hand it may make its last will and testament before the eyes of all the world and declare in the name of the people itself: Everything that exists has this much worth, that it will perish.\n\n It is not enough to say, as the French do, that their nation has been taken by surprise. A nation and a woman are not forgiven the unguarded hour in which the first adventurer that came along could violate them. The riddle is not solved by such terms of speech, but merely formulated in another way. It remains to be explained how a nation of thirty-six millions can be surprised and delivered unresisting into captivity by three high class swindlers.\n\n Let us recapitulate in their general outlines the phases that the French Revolution has gone through from February 24, 1848, to December 1851.\n\n Three main periods are unmistakable: the February period; the period of the constituting of the republic or of the Constituent National Assembly, May 4, 1848 , to May 29, 1849; the period of the constitutional republic or of the Legislative National Assembly, May 29, 1849, to December 2, 1851.\n\n The first period, from February 24, or the overthrow of' Louis Philippe, to May 4, 1848, the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, the February period proper, may be described as the prologue of the Revolution. Its character was officially expressed in the fact that the government improvised by it declared itself to be provisional and, like the government, everything that was instigated, attempted or enunciated during this period, proclaimed itself to be provisional. Nothing and nobody ventured to lay claim to the right of existence and of real action. All the elements that had prepared or determined the Revolution, the dynastic opposition, the republican bourgeoisie, the democratic-republican petty bourgeoisie and the social-democratic workers, provisionally found their place in the February government.\n\n It could not be otherwise. The February days originally intended an electoral reform, by which the circle of the politically privileged among the possessing class itself was to be widened and the exclusive domination of the aristocracy of finance overthrown. When it came to the actual conflict, however, when the people mounted the barricades, the National Guard maintained a passive attitude, the army offered no serious resistance and the monarchy ran away, the republic appeared to be a matter of course. Every party construed it in its own sense. Having been won by the proletariat by force of arms, the proletariat impressed its stamp on it and proclaimed it to be a social republic. There was thus indicated the general content of the modern revolution, which stood in most singular contradiction to everything that, with the material at hand, with the degree of education attained by the masses, under the given circumstances and relationships, could be immediately realised in practice. On the other hand, the claims of all the remaining elements that had participated in the February Revolution were recognised by the lion's share that they obtained in the government. In no period do we therefore find a more confused mixture of high-flown phrases and actual uncertainty and clumsiness, of more enthusiastic striving for innovation and more deeply rooted domination of the old routine, of more apparent harmony of the whole society and more profound estrangement of its elements. While the Paris proletariat still revelled in the vision of the wide prospects that had opened before it and indulged in seriously-meant discussions on social problems, the old powers of society had grouped themselves, assembled, reflected and found an unexpected support in the mass of the nation, the peasants and petty bourgeois, who all at once stormed onto the political stage, after the barriers of the July monarchy had fallen.\n\n\n[the revolutionary communists),5 from the public stage for the entire duration of the cycle we are considering.\n\n The bourgeois monarchy of Louis Philippe can only be followed by the bourgeois republic, that is, if a limited section of the bourgeoisie formerly ruled in the name of the king, the whole of the bourgeoisie will now rule in the name of the people. The demands of the Paris proletariat are utopian nonsense to which an end must be put. To this declaration of the Constituent National Assembly the Paris proletariat replied with the June Insurrection, the most colossal event in the history of European civil wars. The bourgeois republic triumphed. On its side stood the aristocracy of finance, the industrial bourgeoisie, the middle class, the petty bourgeois, the army, the lumpenproletariat organised as the Mobile Guard, the intellectual lights, the clergy, and the rural population. On the side of the Paris proletariat stood none but itself. More than three thousand insurgents were butchered after the victory, and fifteen thousand were transported without trial. With this defeat the proletariat passes into the background of the revolutionary stage. It attempts to press forward again on every occasion, as soon as the movement appears to make a fresh start, but with ever decreased expenditure of strength and always more insignificant results. As soon as one of the social strata situated above it gets into revolutionary ferment, it enters into an alliance with it and so shares all the defeats that the different parties suffer one after another. But these subsequent blows become steadily weaker, the more they are distributed over the entire surface of society. Its more important leaders in the Assembly and the press successively fall victims to the courts, and ever more equivocal figures come to the fore. In part it throws itself into doctrinaire experiments, exchange banks and workers' associations, hence into a movement in which it renounces the revolutionising of the old world by means of its own great, combined resources, and seeks, rather, to achieve its salvation behind society's back, in private fashion, within its limited conditions of existence, and hence inevitably suffers shipwreck. It seems to be unable either to rediscover revolutionary greatness in itself or to win new energy from the alliances newly entered into, until all classes with which it contended in June themselves lie prostrate beside i t. But a t least it succumbs with the honours of the great, world-historic struggle; not only France, but all Europe trembles at the June earthquake, while the ensuing defeats of the upper classes are so cheaply bought that they require bare-faced exaggeration by the victorious party to be able to pass for events at all and become the more ignominious the further the defeated party is removed from the proletariat.\n\n The defeat of the June insurgents, to be sure, had now prepared and levelled the ground on which the bourgeois republic could be founded and built up, but it had shown at the same time that in Europe there are other questions involved than that of \"republic or monarchy.\" It had revealed that here bourgeois republic signifies the unlimited despotism of one class over other classes. It had proved that in lands with an old civilisation, with a developed formation of classes, with modern conditions of production and with an intellectual consciousness into which all traditional ideas have been absorbed by the work of centuries, the republic signifies in general only the political form of the revolution of bourgeois society and not its conservative form of life, as, for example, in the United States of North America, where, though classes, indeed, already exist, they have not yet become fixed, but continually change and interchange their elements in a constant state of flux, where the modern means of production, instead of coinciding with a stagnant surplus population, rather supply the relative deficiency of heads and hands and where, finally, the feverishly youthful movement of material production, that has a new world to make its own, has left neither time nor opportunity for abolishing the old spirit world.\n\n During the June days all classes and parties had united in the Party of Order against the proletarian cIass as the party of anarchy, of socialism, of communism. They had \"saved\" society from \"the enemies of society.\" They had given out the watchwords of the old society, \"property, family, religion, order,\" to their army as passwords and had proclaimed to the counter-revolutionary crusaders: \"In this sign you will conquer!\" From that moment, as soon as one of the numerous parties which had gathered under this sign against the June insurgents seeks to hold the revolutionary battlefield in its own class interests it goes down before the cry: \"Property, family, religion, order.\" Society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts, as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one. Every demand of the simplest bourgeois financial reform, of the most ordinary liberalism, of the most formal republicanism, of the most insipid democracy, is simultaneously castigated as an \"attempt on society\" and stigmatised as \"socialism.\" And, finally, the high priests of \"religion and order\" themselves are driven with kicks from their Pythian tripods, hauled out of their beds in the darkness of night, put in prison-vans, thrown into dungeons or sent into exile; their temple is razed to the ground, their mouths are sealed, their pens broken, their law torn to pieces in the name of religion, of property, of family, of order. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down on their balconies by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their houses bombarded for amusement-in the name of property, of family, of religion and of order. Finally the scum of bourgeois society forms the holy phalanx of order and the hero Crapulinsky6 installs himself in the Tuileries7 as the \"saviour of society.\"\n\n * * *\n\n VII\n\n On the threshold of the February Revolution, the social republic appeared as a phrase, as a prophecy. In the June days of 1848, it was drowned in the blood o f the Paris proletariat, but it haunts the subsequent acts o f the drama like a ghost. The democratic republic makes its appearance. On June 13, 1849, it is dissipated together with its petty bourgeois, who take to their heels, but in its flight it blows its own trumpet with redoubled boastfulness. The parliamentary republic, together with the bourgeoisie, takes possession of the entire stage; it lives out its existence to the fun, but December 2, 1851, buries it to the accompaniment of the cry of terror of the royalists in coalition: \"Long live the republic!\"\n\n The French bourgeoisie offered resistance to the domination of the working proletariat; it has brought the lumpenproletariat to domination, with the chief of the Society of December 10 at the head. The bourgeoisie kept France in breathless fear of the future terrors of red anarchy; Bonaparte discounted this future for it when, on December 4, he had the eminent bourgeois of the Boulevard Montmartre and the Boulevard des Ita liens shot down at their windows by the army of order, whose enthusiasm was inspired by liquor. It apotheosised the sword; the sword rules it. It destroyed the revolutionary press; its own press has been destroyed. It placed public meetings under police supervision; its salons are under the supervision of the police. It disbanded the democratic National Guard; its own National Guard has been disbanded. It imposed the state of siege; the state of siege has been imposed on it. It supplanted the juries by military commissions; its juries are supplanted by military commissions; it subjected public education to the priests; the priests subject it to their own education. It transported people without trial; it is transported without trial. It suppressed every stirring in society by means of the state power; every stirring in its society is repressed by means of the state power. Out of enthusiasm for its purse, it rebelled against its own politicians and men of letters; its politicians and men of letters are swept aside, but its purse is plundered now that its mouth has been gagged and its pen broken. The bourgeoisie never wearied of crying out to the revolution what Saint Arsenius cried out to the Christians: \"Fuge, tace, quiesce!\" Flee, be silent, keep quiet! Bonaparte cries to the bourgeoisie: \"Fuge, tace, quiesce!\" Flee, be silent, keep quiet!\n\n The French bourgeoisie had long since found the solution to Napoleon 's dilemma: \"Dans cinquante ans l\u2019Europe sera r\u00e9publicaine ou cosaque.\"8 It had found the solution to it in the \"r\u00e9publique cosaque.\" No Circe, by means of black magic, has distorted that work of art, the bourgeois republic, into a monstrous shape. That republic has nothing but the semblance of respectability. The present-day France was contained in a finished state within the parliamentary republic. It only required a bayonet thrust for the bubble to burst and the monster to spring forth before our eyes.\n\n\n[The immediate aim of the February Revolution was to overthrow the Orleans dynasty and the section of the bourgoisie that ruled during its reign. This aim was only attained on December 2, 1851. The immense possessions of the house of Orleans, the real basis of its influence, were now confiscated and what had been expected after the February Revolution came to pass after the December co up-prison, flight, dismissal, banishment, disarming, derision for the men who since 1830 had wearied France with their renown. But under Louis Philippe only a part of the commercial bourgeoisie ruled. Its other sections formed a dynastic and a republican opposition or were altogether disfranchised. Only the parliamentary republic accepted all sections of the commercial bourgeoisie into its sphere of state. Under Louis Philippe, moreover, the commercial bourgeoisie excluded the landowning bourgeoisie. Only the parliamentary republic set them side by side, with equal rights, married the July monarchy to the Legitimist monarchy and fused two epochs of property rule into one. Under Louis Philippe, the favoured section of the bourgeoisie concealed its rule under cover of the crown; in the parliamentary republic the rule of the bourgeoisie, after it had united all its elements and extended its realm to be the realm of its class, revealed its uncovered head. Thus the revolution itself had first to create the form in which the rule of the bourgeoisie could obtain its broadest, most general and final expression, and therefore could also be overthrown without being able to arise again.\n\n Only now was the judgment, passed in February, executed on the Orleanist bourgeoisie, that is, on the most vital section of the French bourgeoisie. Now it was defeated in its parliament, its bar, its commercial courts, its provincial representative bodies, its notaries, its university, its tribune and its tribunals, its press and its literature, its administrative revenues and its court fees, its army pay and its state incomes, in its mind and in its body. Blanqui had made the disbandment of the bourgeois guards the first demand on the revolution, and the bourgeois guards, who in February offered the revolution their hand in order to hinder its progress, vanished from the scene in December. The Pantheon itself becomes transformed into an ordinary church . With the final form of the bourgeois regime the spell is likewise broken which transfigured its initiators of the eighteenth century into saints.] 9\n\n Why did not the Paris proletariat rise in revolt after December? The overthrow of the bourgeoisie had as yet only been decreed; the decree had not been carried out. Any serious insurrection of the proletariat would at once have put fresh life into the bourgeoisie, would have reconciled it with the army and would have ensured a second June defeat for the workers.\n\n On December 4 the proletariat was incited to fight by the bourgeois and the small shopkeepers. On the evening of that day several legions of the National Guard promised to appear, armed and uniformed, on the scene of action. For the bourgeois and the small shopkeepers had found out that in one of his decrees of December 2 Bonaparte abolished the secret ballot and enjoined them to record their \"yes\" or \"no\" in the official registers after their names. The resistance of December 4 intimidated Bonaparte. During the night he caused placards to be posted on all the street corners o f Paris, announcing the restoration of the secret ballot. The bourgeois and the small shopkeepers believed that they had gained their end. Those who failed to appear next morning were the bourgeois and the small shopkeepers.\n\n By a coup de main during the night of December 1 to 2, Bonaparte had robbed the Paris proletariat of its leaders, the barricade commanders. An army without officers, made disinclined to fight under the banner of the Montagnards by the memories of June 1848 and 1849 and May 1850, it left to its vanguard, the secret societies, the task of saving the insurrectionary honour of Paris, which the bourgeoisie had so spinelessly surrendered to the soldiers that, later on, Bonaparte could sneeringly give as his motive for disarming the National Guard-his fear that its arms would be turned against itself by anarchists!\n\n \"C'est le triomphe complet et d\u00e9finitif du socialisme!\"l Thus Guizot characterised December 2. But if the overthrow of the parliamentary republic contains within itself the germ o f the triumph of the proletarian revolution, its immediate and obvious result was the victory of Bonaparte over parliament, of the executive power over the legislative power, of force without phrases over the force of phrases. In parliament the nation made its general will the law, that is, it made the law of the ruling class its general will. Before the executive power it renounces all will of its own and surrenders itself to the superior orders of something alien, of authority. The executive power, in contrast to the legislative power, expresses the heteronomy2 of the nation, in contrast to its autonomy. France, therefore, seems to have escaped the despotism of a class only to fall back beneath the despotism of an individual and, what is more, beneath the authority of an individual without authority. The struggle seems to be settled in such a way that all classes, equally impotent and equally mute, fall on their knees before the club.\n\n But the revolution is thorough-going. It is still in process of passing through purgatory. It does its work methodically. By December 2, 1851, it had completed one half of its preparatory work; it is now completing the other half. First it perfected the parliamentary power, in order to be able to overthrow it. Now that it has attained this, it perfects the executive power, reduces it to its purest expression, isolates it, sets it up against itself as the sole target, in order to concentrate all its forces of destruction against it. And when it has done this second half of its preliminary work, Europe will leap from her seat and exultantly exclaim: Well grubbed, old mole!3\n\n This executive power with its enormous bureaucratic and military organisation, with its artificial state machinery embracing wide strata, with a host of officials numbering half a million, besides an army of another half million, this appalling parasitic growth, which enmeshes the body of French society like a net and chokes all its pores, sprang up in the days of the absolute monarchy, with the decay of the feudal system, which it helped to hasten. The seigniorial privileges of the landowners and towns became transformed into so many attributes of the state power, the feudal dignitaries into paid officials and the motley pattern of conflicting medi\u00e6val plenary powers into the regulated plan of a state authority, whose work is divided and centralised as in a factory. The first French Revolution, with its task of breaking all local, territorial, urban and provincial independent powers in order to create the bourgeois unity of the nation, was bound to develop what the absolute monarchy had begun-centralisation, but at the same time the extent, the attributes and the agents o f governmental authority. Napoleon perfected this state machinery. The Legitimist monarchy and the July monarchy added nothing but a greater division of labour, growing in the same measure that the division of labour within bourgeois society created new groups o f interests, and, therefore, new material for state administration. Every common interest was straightaway severed from society, counter-posed to it as a higher, general interest, snatched from the self-activity of society's members and made an object of governmental activity from the bridge, the school-house and the communal property of a village community to the railways, the national wealth and the national university of France. The parliamentary republic, finally, in its struggle against the revolution, found itself compelled to strengthen, along with the repressive measures, the resources and centralisation of governmental power. All the revolutions perfected this machine instead of smashing it. The parties that contended in turn for domination regarded the possession of this huge state edifice as the principal spoils of the victor.\n\n But under the absolute monarchy, during the first revolution, and under Napoleon, bureaucracy was only the means of preparing the class rule of the bourgeoisie. Under the Restoration, under Louis Philippe and under the parliamentary republic, it was the instrument of the ruling class, however much it strove for power of its own.\n\n Only under the second Bonaparte does the state seem to have made itself completely independent. As against bourgeois society, the state machine has consolidated its position so thoroughly that the chief of the Society of December 10 suffices for its head, an adventurer blown in from abroad, elevated on the shield by a drunken soldiery, which he has bought with liquor and sausages, and which he must continually ply with sausage anew. Hence the downcast despair, the feeling of most dreadful humiliation and degradation that oppresses the breast of France and makes her catch her breath. She feels herself dishonoured.\n\n And yet the state power is not suspended in mid-air. Bonaparte represents a class, and the most numerous class of French society at that, the small peasants.\n\n Just as the Bourbons were the dynasty of large landed property and just as the Orleans were the dynasty o f money, so the Bonapartes are the dynasty of the peasants, that is, the mass of the French people. Not the Bonaparte who submitted to the bourgeois parliament, but the Bonaparte who dispersed it is the chosen of the peasantry. For three years the towns had succeeded in falsifying the meaning of the election of December 10 and in cheating the peasants out of the restoration of the Empire. The election of December 10, 1848, was consummated only by the coup d'\u00e9tat of December 2, 1851.\n\n The small peasants form a vast mass, the members of which live in similar conditions, but without entering into manifold relations with one another. Their mode of production isolates them from one another, instead of bringing them into mutual intercourse. The isolation is increased by France's bad means of communication and by the poverty of the peasants. Their field of production, the small holding, admits of no division of labour in its cultivation, no application of science and, therefore, no multiplicity of development, no diversity of talents, no wealth of social relationships. Each individual peasant family is almost self-sufficient; it itself directly produces the major part of its consumption and thus acquires its means of life more through exchange with nature than in intercourse with society. The small holding, the peasant and his family; alongside them another small holding, another peasant and another family. A few score of these make up a village, and a few score of villages make up a Department. In this way, the great mass of the French nation is formed by simple addition of homologous magnitudes, much as potatoes in a sack form a sackful of potatoes. In so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that divide their mode of life, their interests and their culture from those of the other classes, and put them in hostile contrast to the latter, they form a class . In so far as there is merely a local interconnection among these small peasants, and the identity of their interests begets no unity, no national union and no political organisation, they do not form a class. They are consequently incapable of enforcing their class interest in their own name, whether through a parliament or through a convention. They cannot represent themselves, they must be represented. Their representative must at the same time appear as their master, as an authority over them, as an unlimited governmental power that protects them against the other classes and sends them the rain and the sunshine from above. The political influence of the small peasants, therefore, finds its final expression in the executive power subordinating society to itself.\n\n Historical tradition gave rise to the faith of the French peasants in the miracle that a man named Napoleon would bring all the glory back to them. And an individual was found who gives himself out as the man because he bears the name of Napoleon, in consequence of the Code Napol\u00e9on 4 which lays down that la recherch\u00e9 de la paternit\u00e9 est interdite.5 After being a vagabond for twenty years and after a series of grotesque adventures, the legend finds fulfillment and the man becomes Emperor of the French. The fixed idea of the nephew was realised, because it coincided with the fixed idea of the most numerous class of the French people.\n\n But, it may be objected, what about the peasant risings in half of France, the hounding of masses of peasants by the army, the mass incarceration and transportation o f the peasants?\n\n Since Louis XIV, France has experienced no similar persecution of the peasants \"on account of demagogic intrigues.\"\n\n But let there be no misunderstanding. The Bonaparte dynasty represents not the revolutionary, but the conservative peasant; not the peasant that strikes out beyond the condition of his social existence, the small holding, but rather the peasant who wants to consolidate it; not the country folk who want to overthrow the old order through their own energies linked up with the towns, but on the contrary those who, in stupefied bondage to this old order, want to see themselves with their small holding saved and favoured by the ghost of the empire. It represents not the enlightenment, but the superstition of the peasant; not his judgment, but his prejudice; not his future, but his past; not his modern Cevennes, 6 but his modern Vendee.7\n\n The three years' rigorous rule of the parliamentary republic had freed a part of the French peasants from the Napoleonic illusion and had revolutionised them, even if only superficially, but the bourgoisie violently repressed them, as often as they set themselves in motion. Under the parliamentary republic the modern and the traditional consciousness of the French peasant contended for mastery. The contest proceeded in the form of an incessant struggle between the schoolmasters and the priests. The bourgeoisie struck down the schoolmasters. For the first time, the peasants made efforts to behave independently in the face of governmental activity. This was shown in the continual conflict between the mayors and the prefects. The bourgeoisie deposed the mayors. Finally, during the period of the parliamentary republic, the peasants of different localities rose against their own offspring, the army. The bourgeoisie punished them with states of siege and distraints on their goods. And this same bourgeoisie now cries out about the stupidity of the masses, the vile multitude, that has betrayed it to Bonaparte. It has itself forcibly strengthened the imperialism8 of the peasant class, it held fast to the conditions that form the birthplace of this peasant religion. The bourgeoisie, to be sure, is bound to fear the stupidity of the masses, as long as they remain conservative, and the insight of the masses, as soon as they become revolutionary.\n\n In the risings after the coup d'\u00e9tat, a part of the French peasants protested, arms in hand, against their own vote of December 10, 1848. The school they had gone through since 1848 had sharpened their wits. But they had made themselves over to the underworld of history; history held them to their word, and the majority was still so bound that in precisely the reddest Departments the peasant population voted openly for Bonaparte.9 In its view, the National Assembly had hindered his progress . He had now merely broken the fetters that the town had imposed on the will of the countryside. In some parts the peasants even entertained the grotesque notion of a Convention1 side by side with a Napoleon.\n\n After the first revolution had transformed the peasants from semi-villeins into freeholders, Napoleon confirmed and regulated the conditions on which they could exploit undisturbed the soil of France which had only just come into their possession and slake their youthful passion for property. But what is now causing the ruin of the French peasant is his dwarf holding itself, the division of the land, the form of property which Napoleon consolidated in France. It is precisely the material conditions which made the feudal peasant into a small peasant and Napoleon into an emperor. Two generations have sufficed to produce the inevitable result: progressive deterioration of agriculture, progressive indebtedness of the agriculturist. The \"Napoleonic\" form of property, which at the beginning of the nineteenth century was the condition for the liberation and enrichment of the French country folk, has developed in the course of this century as the law of their enslavement and pauperisation. And it is just this law which is the first of the \"id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes\" which the second Bonaparte has to uphold. If he still shares with the peasants the illusion that the cause of their ruin is to be sought not in this small holding property itself but outside it in the influence of secondary causes, then his experiments will burst like soap bubbles when they come into contact with the relations of production.\n\n\n[Even the favouring of the peasant class was in the interest of the new bourgeois order. This newly-created class was the many-sided extension of the bourgeois regime beyond the gates of the towns, its realisation on a national scale.]2 This class was the ubiquitous protest against the landed aristocracy which had just been overthrown.\n\n\n[If it was favoured above all, it, above all, offered the point of attack for the restoration of the feudal lands.]\n\n The roots that this small holding property struck in French soil deprived feudalism of all nutriment. Its landmarks formed the natural fortifications of the bourgeoisie against any coup de main on the part of its old overlords. But in the course of the nineteenth century the feudal lords were replaced by urban usurers; the feudal obligation that went with the land was replaced by the mortgage; aristocratic landed property was replaced by bourgeois capital. The small holding of the peasant is now only the pretext that allows the capitalist to draw profits, interest and rent from the soil, while leaving it to the tiller of the soil himself to see how he can extract his wages. The mortgage debt burdening the soil of France imposes on the French peasantry payment of an amount o f interest equal to the annual interest on the entire British national debt. Small-holding property, in this enslavement by capital to which its development inevitably pushes forward, has transformed the mass 'of the French nation into troglodytes. Sixteen million peasants (including women and children) dwell in hovels, a large number of which have but one opening, others only two and the most favoured only three. And windows are t o a house what the five senses are to the head. The bourgeois order, which at the beginning of the century set the state to stand guard over the newly arisen small holding and manured it with laurels, has become a vampire that sucks out its blood and marrow and throws them into the alchemistic cauldron of capital. The Code Napol\u00e9on is now nothing but a codex of distraints, forced sales and compulsory auctions. To the four million (including children, etc.) officially recognised paupers, vagabonds, criminals and prostitutes in France must be added five millions who hover on the margin o f existence and either have their haunts in the countryside itself or, with their rags and their children, continually desert the countryside for the towns and the towns for the countryside. The interests of the peasants, therefore, are no longer, as under Napoleon, in accord with, but in opposition to the interests of the bourgeoisie, to capital. Hence the peasants find their natural ally and leader in the urban proletariat, whose task is the overthrow of the bourgeois order. But strong and unlimited government-and this is the second \"id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes\" which the second Napoleon has to carry out-is called upon to defend by force this \"material\" order. This \"material order\" also serves as the catchword in all Bonaparte's proclamations against the rebellious peasants.\n\n Besides the mortgage which capital imposes on it, the small holding is burdened by taxes. Taxes are the source o f life for the bureaucracy, the army, the priests and the court, in short, for the whole apparatus o f the executive power. Strong government and heavy taxes are identical. By its very nature, small holding property forms a suitable basis for an all-powerful and innumerable bureaucracy. It creates a uniform level of relationships and persons over the who le surface of the land. Hence it also permits of uniform action from a supreme centre on all points of this uniform mass. It annihilates the aristocratic intermediate grades between the mass of the people and the state power. On all sides, therefore, it calls forth the direct interference of this state power and the intervention of its immediate organs. Finally, it produces an unemployed surplus population for which there i s no place either on the land or in the towns, and which accordingly reaches out for state offices as a sort of respectable alms, and provokes the creation of state posts .\n\n\n[Under Napoleon this numerous governmental personnel was not merely immediately productive, inasmuch as, through the means of compulsion of the state, it executed on behalf of the newly arisen peasantry, in the form of public works, etc., what the bourgeoisie could not yet accomplish by way of private industry. State taxes were a necessary means of compulsion to maintain exchange between town and country. Otherwise, the owner of a dwarf holding would in his rustic self-sufficiency have severed his connection with the townsman, as in Norway and a part of Switzerland.]\n\n By the new markets which he opened at the point of the bayonet, and by the plundering of the Continent, Napoleon repaid the compulsory taxes with interest. These taxes were a spur to the industry of the peasant, whereas now they rob his industry of its last sources of aid and complete his powerlessness to resist pauperism. And an enormous bureaucracy, well-dressed and well-fed, is the \"id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes\" which is most congenial of all to the second Bonaparte. How could it be otherwise, seeing that alongside the actual classes of society, he is forced to create an artificial caste, for which the maintenance of his regime becomes a bread-and-butter question? Accordingly, one of his first financial operations was the raising of officials' salaries to their old level again and the creation of new sinecures.\n\n\n[-whose mission under the second Bonaparte is to keep watch over, not the enemies of the peasant regime in the towns, as under Napoleon, but the enemies of Bonaparte in the country] . On the next occasion, the expedition against Rome will take place in France itself, but in a sense opposite to that of M. de Montalembert.3\n\n Finally, the culminating point of the \"id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennes\" is the preponderance of the army. The army was the point d'honneur of the peasants, it was they themselves transformed into heroes, defending their new possessions against the outer world, glorifying their recently won nationality, plundering and revolutionising the world. The uniform was their own state dress; war was their poetry; the small holding, extended and rounded off in imagination, was their fatherland, and patriotism the ideal form of the property sense. But the enemies against whom the French peasant has now to defend his property are not the Cossacks; they are the hussiers4 and the tax collectors. The small holding lies no longer in the so-called fatherland, but in the register of mortgages. The army itself is no longer the flower of the peasant youth; it is the swamp-flower of the peasant lumpenproletariat. It consists in large measure of rempla\u00e7ants, of substitutes, just as the second Bonaparte is himself only a rempla\u00e7ant, the substitute for Napoleon. It now performs its deeds of valour by hounding the peasants in masses like chamois, by discharging gendarme duties, and when the internal contradictions of his system chase the chief of the Society of December 10 over the French border, his army, after some acts of brigandage, will reap, not laurels, but thrashings.\n\n One sees: all id\u00e9es napol\u00e9oniennesare the ideas of the undeveloped small holding in the freshness of its youth: for the small holding that has outlived its day they are an absurdity. They are only the hallucinations of its death struggle, words that are reduced to phrases, spirits reduced to ghosts. But the parody of imperialism was necessary to free the mass of the French nation from the weight of tradition and to work out in pure form the opposition between the state power and society. With the progressive undermining of this small holding property, the state structure erected upon it collapses. The state centralisation that modern society requires arises only on the ruins of the military-bureaucratic governmental machinery which was forged in opposition to feudalism.\n\n\n[The demolition of the state machine will not endanger centralisation. Bureaucracy is only the low and brutal form of a centralisation that is still afflicted with its opposite, with feudalism. On coming to despair of the Napoleonic Restoration, the French peasant parts with his belief in his small holding, the entire state edifice erected on this small holding falls to the ground and the proletarian revolution obtains that chorus without which its solo song in all peasant nations becomes a swan song.]\n\n French peasant relationships provide us with the answer to the riddle of the general elections of December 20 and 21, which bore the second Napoleon up Mount Sinai, not to receive laws, but to give them .\n\n\n[To be sure, on those fateful days the French nation committed a deadly sin against democracy, which is on its knees and prays daily: Holy universal suffrage, intercede for us! Naturally, the believers in universal suffrage do not want to renounce a miraculous power that has accomplished such great things in regard to themselves, which has transformed Bonaparte II into a Napoleon, a Saul into a Paul and a Simon into a Peter. The spirit of the people speaks to them through the ballot-box as the god of the prophet Ezekiel spoke to the marrowless bones: \"Haec dicit dominus dues ossibus suis: Ecce, ego intromittam in vos spiritum et vivetis.\" ''Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.\"]\n\n\n[Despotism or anarchy. Naturally, it voted for despotism.] When the puritans at the Council of Constance complained of the dissolute lives of the popes and wailed about the necessity of moral reform, Cardinal Pierre d'Ai1ly thundered to them : \"Only the devil in person can now save the Catholic Church, and you ask for angels. \"In like manner, after the coup d'\u00e9tat, the French bourgeoisie cried: Only the chief of the Society of December 10 can now save bourgeois society! Only theft can now save property; only perjury, religion; only bastardy, the family; only disorder, order!,\n\n As the executive authority which has made itself an independent power, Bonaparte feels it to be his mission to safeguard \"civil order.\" But the strength of this civil order lies in the middle class. He looks on himself, therefore, as the representative of the middle class and issues decrees in this sense. Nevertheless, he is somebody solely due to the fact that he has broken the political power of this middle class and daily breaks it anew. Consequently, he looks on himself as the adversary of the political and literary power of the middle class. But by protecting its material power, he generates its political power anew. The cause must accordingly be kept alive; but the effect, where it manifests itself, must be done away with. But this cannot pass off without slight confusions of cause and effect, since in their interaction both lose their distinguishing features. New decrees, that obliterate the border-line. At the same time, Bonaparte looks on himself as the representative of the peasants, and of the people in general, against the bourgeoisie, who wants to make the lower classes of the people happy within the frame of bourgeois society. New decrees, that cheat the \"true socialists\" of their statecraft in advance. But, above all, Bonaparte looks on himself as the chief of the Society of December 10, as the representative of the lumpenproletariat to which he himself, his entourage, his government and his army belong, and for which the prime consideration is to benefit itself and draw California lottery prizes from the state treasury. And he makes good his position as chief of the Society of December 10 with decrees, without decrees and despite decrees.\n\n This contradictory task of the man explains the contradictions of his government, the confused groping hither and thither which seeks now to win, now to humiliate first one class and then another and arrays all of them uniformly against him, whose practical uncertainty forms a highly comical contrast to the imperious categorical style of the government decrees, a style which is copied obsequiously from the Uncle.\n\n Industry and trade, hence the business affairs of the middle class, are to prosper in hot-house fashion under the strong government. Granting of innumerable railway concessions. But the Bonapartist lumpenproletariat is to enrich itself. Trickery with the railway concessions on the Bourse by those previously initiated. But no capital is forthcoming for the railways. Obligation of the Bank to make advances on railway shares. But, at the same time, the Bank is to be exploited for personal ends and therefore must be cajoled . Release of the Bank from the obligation to publish its report weekly. Leonine agreement5 of the Bank with the government. The people are to be given employment. Inauguration of public works. But the public works increase the obligations of the people in respect of taxes. Therefore, reduction of the taxes by an onslaught on the rentiers,6 by conversion of the five per cent bonds to four-and-a-half per cent. But, once more, the middle class must receive a sop. Therefore doubling of the wine tax for the people, who buy it en detail,7 and halving of the wine tax for the middle class, who drink it en gros.8 Dissolution of the actual workers' associations, but promises of miracles of association in the future. The peasants are to be helped. Mortgage banks, that expedite their getting into debt and accelerate the concentration of property. But these banks are to be used to make money out of the confiscated estates of the house of Orleans. No capitalist wants to agree to this condition, which is not in the decrees, and the mortgage bank remains a mere decree, etc., etc.\n\n Bonaparte would like to appear as the patriarchal benefactor of all classes. But he cannot give to one class without taking from another. Just as at the time of the Fronde it was said o f the Duke of Guise that he was the most obligeant man in France because he had turned all his possessions into his partisans' obligations to him, so Bonaparte would fain be the most obligeant man in France and turn all the property, all the labour of France into a personal obligation to himself. He would like to steal - the whole of France in order to be able to make a present of her to France or, rather, in order to be able to buy France anew with French money, for as the chief of the Society of December 10 he must needs buy what ought to belong to him. And all the state institutions, the Senate, the Council o f State, the legislative body, the Legion of Honour, the soldiers' medals, the wash-houses, the public works, the railways, the \u00e9tat major9 of the National Guard to the exclusion of privates, and the confiscated estates of the house of Orleans-all become parts of the institution of purchase. Every place in the army and in the government machine becomes a means for purchase. B ut the most important feature of this process, whereby France is taken in order to give to her, is the percentages that find their way to the head and the members of the Society of December 10 during the turnover. The witticism with which Countess L., the mistress of M. de Morny, characterised the confiscation of the Orleans estates: \"C' est le premier vol de l'aigle,\"1 is applicable to every flight of the eagle, which is more like a raven. He himself and his adherents call out to one another daily like that Italian Carthusian admonishing the miser who, with boastful display, counted up the goods on which he could yet live for years to come: \"Tu fai canto sopra i beni, bisogna prima far il conto sopra gli anni.\"2 Lest they make a mistake in the years, they count the minutes . At the court, in the ministries, at the head of the administration and the army, a crowd of fellows pushes forward, of the best o f whom it can be said that no one knows whence he comes, a noisy, disreputable, rapacious Boh\u00e9me that dresses itself in gallooned coats with the same caricature of dignity as the high dignitaries of Soulouque. One can visualise clearly this upper stratum of the Society of December 10, if one reflects that Veron-Crevel3 is its preacher of morals and Granier de Cassagnac its thinker. When Guizot, at the time of his ministry, utilised this Granier on a hole-and-corner newspaper against the dynastic opposition, he used to boast of him with the quip: \u201cC'est le roi des droles,\" \"he is the king of buffoons.\" One would do wrong to recall the Regency of Louis XV in connection with Louis Bonaparte's court and clique. For \"often alread, France has experienced a government of mistresses; but never before, a government of hommes entretenus.\"4\n\n Driven by the contradictory demands of his situation, and, at the same time, like a conjurer under the necessity of keeping the public gaze fixed on himself, as Napoleon's subsitute, by constant surprises, hence of executing a coup d'\u00e9tat en miniature every day, Bonaparte throws the entire bourgeois economy into confusion, lays hands on everything that seemed inviolable to the revolution of 1848, makes some tolerant of revolution, others desirous o f revolution, and produces actual anarchy in the name of order, while at the same time he divests the whole state machine of its halo, profanes it and makes it at once loathsome and ridiculous. The cult of the Holy Coat of Treves5 he duplicates at Paris in the cult of the Napoleonic imperial mantle. But if the imperial mantle finally falls on the shoulders of Louis Bonaparte, the iron statue of Napoleon will crash from the top of the Vend\u00f4me column.\n\n The Civil War In France\n\n KARL MARX\n\nThis, the last of Marx's great political pamphlets, was composed during the Paris Revolution of September, 1870-May, 1871, and read by Marx to the General Council of the International Working Men's Association on May 30, 1871, only two days after the last resistance of the Paris Commune's fighters was overcome. In addition to providing an immensely vivid and trenchant account of the Commune and its fate, the Address was a major contribution to Marxist theory of the state and of the revolutionary process itself from the political point of view. It treated the Paris Commune as the short-lived but momentous first example in history of a \"dictatorship of the proletariat.\" In preparing the document for publication as a separate pamphlet on the twentieth anniversary of the Paris Commune in 1891, Engels included in the publication two shorter addresses by Marx on the Franco-Prussian War, in which the Paris Revolution had its origin. Parts III and IV of the pamphlet are reprinted here.\n\n Introduction\n\n I did not anticipate that I would be asked to prepare a new edition of the Address of the General Council of the International on The Civil War in France, and to write an introduction to it. Therefore I can only touch briefly here on the most important points.\n\n I am prefacing the longer work mentioned above by the two shorter Addresses of the General Council on the Franco-Prussian War. In the first place, because the second of these, which itself cannot be fully understood in full without the first, is referred to in The Civil War. But also because these two Addresses, likewise drafted by Marx, are, no less than The Civil War, outstanding examples of the author's remarkable gift, first proved in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, for grasping clearly the character, the import and the necessary consequences of great historical events, at a time when these events are still in progress before our eyes or have only just taken place. And, finally, because today we in Germany are still having to endure the consequences which Marx predicted would follow from these events.\n\n Has that which was declared in the first Address not come to pass: that if Germany's defensive war against Louis Bonaparte degenerated into a war of conquest against the French people, all the misfortunes which befell Germany after the so-called wars of liberation1 would revive again with renewed intensity? Have we not had a further twenty years of Bismarck's rule, the Exceptional Law and Socialist-baiting taking the place of the prosecutions of demagogues, with the same arbitrary action of the police and with literally the same staggering interpretations of the law?\n\n And has not the prediction been proved to the letter, that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine would \"force France into the arms of Russia,\" and that after this annexation Germany must either become the avowed servant of Russia, or must, after some short respite, arm for a new war, and, moreover, \"a race war against the combined Slavonic and Roman races\"? Has not the annexation of the French provinces driven France into the arms of Russia? Has not Bismarck for fully twenty years vainly wooed the favour of the tsar, wooed it with services even more lowly than those which little Prussia, before it became the \"first Power in Europe,\" was wont to lay at Holy Russia's feet? And is there not every day still hanging over our heads the Damocles' sword of war, on the first day of which all the chartered covenants of princes will be scattered like chaff; a war of which nothing is certain but the absolute uncertainty of its outcome; a race war which will subject the whole of Europe to devastation by fifteen or twenty million armed men, and which is not raging already only because even the strongest of the great military states shrinks before the absolute incalculability of its final result?\n\n All the more is it our duty to make again accessible to the German workers these brilliant proofs, now half-forgotten, of the farsightedness of international working-class policy in 1870.\n\n What is true of these two Addresses is also true of The Civil War in France. On May :z. 8, the last fighters of the Commune succumb bed to superior forces on the slopes of Belleville; and only two days later, on May 3 0, Marx read to the General Council the work in which the historical significance of the Paris Commune is delineated in short, powerful strokes, but with such trenchancy, and above all such truth as has never again been attained in all the mass of literature on this subject.\n\n Thanks to the economic and political development of France s ince 1 789, Paris has been placed for the last fifty years in such a position that no revolution could break out there without assuming a proletarian character, that is to say, without the proletariat, which had bought victory with its blood, advancing its own demands after victory. These demands were more or less unclear and even confused, corresponding to the state of development reached by the workers of Paris at the particular period, but in the last resort they all amounted to the abolition of the class antagonism between capitalists and workers. It is true that no one knew how this was to be brought about. But the demand itself, however indefinitely it still was couched, contained a threat to the existing order of society; the workers who put it forward were still armed; therefore, the disarming of the workers was the first commandment for the bourgeois, who were at the helm of the state. Hence, after every revolution won by the workers, a new struggle, ending with the defeat of the workers.\n\n This happened for the first time in 1848. The liberal bourgeois of the parliamentary opposition held banquets for securing a reform of the franchise, which was to ensure supremacy for their party. Forced more and more, in their struggle with the government, to appeal to the people, they had gradually to yield precedence to the radical and republican strata of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. But behind these stood the revolutionary workers, and since 1830 these had acquired far more political independence than the bourgeois, and even the republicans, suspected. At the moment of the crisis between the government and the opposition, the workers begari street-fighting; Louis Philippe vanished, and with him the franchise reform; and in its place arose the republic, and indeed one which the victorious workers themselves designated as a \"social\" republic. No one, however, was clear as to what this social republic was to imply; not even the workers themselves. But they now had arms and were a power in the state. Therefore, as soon as the bourgeois republicans in control felt something like firm ground under their feet, their first aim was to disarm the workers. This took place by driving them into the insurrection of June 1848 by direct breach of faith, by open defiance and the attempt to banish the unemployed to a distant province. The government had taken care to have an overwhelming superiority of force. After five days' heroic struggle, the workers were defeated . And then followed a blood-bath among the defenceless prisoners, the like of which has not been seen since the days of the civil wars which ushered in the downfall of the Roman republic. It was the first time that the bourgeoisie showed to what insane cruelties of revenge it will be goaded the moment the proletariat dares to take its stand against the bourgeoisie as a separate class, with its own interests and demands. And yet 1848 was only child's play compared with the frenzy of the bourgeoisie in 1871.\n\n Punishment followed hard at heel. If the proletariat was not yet able to rule France, the bourgeoisie could no longer do so. At least not at that period, when the greater part of it was still monachically inclined, and it was divided into three dynastic parties and a fourth , republican party. Its internal dissensions allowed the adventurer Louis Bonaparte to take possession of all the commanding points-army, police, administrative machinery-and, on December 2, 1851, to explode the last stronghold of the bourgeoisie, the National Assembly. The Second Empire began-the exploitation of France by a gang of political and financial adventurers, but at the same time also an industrial development such as had never been possible under the narrow-minded and timorous system of Louis Philippe, with the exclusive domination of only a small section of the big bourgeois i.e. Louis Bonaparte took the political power from the capitalists under the pretext of protecting them, the bourgeois, from the workers, and on the other hand the workers from them; but in return his rule encouraged speculation and industrial activity -in a word, the upsurgence and enrichment o f the whole bourgeoisie to an extent hitherto unknown. To an even greater extent, it is true, corruption and mass thievery developed, clustering around the imperial court, and drawing their heavy percentages from this enrichment.\n\n But the Second Empire was the appeal to French chauvinism, was the demand for the restoration of the frontiers of the First Empire, which had been lost in 1814, or at least those of the First Republic. A French empire within the frontiers of the old monarchy and, in -fact, within the even more amputated frontiers of 1815-such a thing was impossible for any length of time. Hence the necessity for occasional wars and extensions of frontiers. But no extension of frontiers was so dazzling to the imagination of the French chauvinists as the extension to the German left bank of the Rhine. One square mile on the Rhine was more to them than ten in the Alps or anywhere else. Given the Second Empire, the demand for the restoration of the left bank of the Rhine, either all at once or piecemeal, was merely a question of time. The time came with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866; cheated of the anticipated \"territorial compensation\" by Bismarck and by his own over-cunning, hesitant policy, there was now nothing left for Napoleon but war, which broke out in 1870 and drove him first to Sedan, and thence to Wilhelmsh\u00f6he.2\n\n The necessary consequence was the Paris Revolution of September 4, 1870. The empire collapsed like a house of cards, and the republic was again proclaimed. But the enemy was standing at the gates; the armies of the empire were either hopelessly encircled at Metz or held captive in Germany. In this emergency the people allowed the Paris deputies to the former legislative body to constitute themselves into a \"Government of National Defence.\" This was the more readily conceded, since, for the purposes of defence, all Parisians capable of bearing arms had enrolled in the National Guard and were armed, so that now the workers constituted a great majority. But very soon the antagonism between the almost completely bourgeois government and the armed proletariat broke into open conflict. On October 31, workers' battalions stormed the town hall and captured part of the membership of the government. Treachery, the government's direct breach of its undertakings, and the intervention of some petty-bourgeois battalions set them free again, and in order not to occasion the outbreak of civil war inside a city besieged by a foreign military power, the former government was left in office.\n\n At last, on January 28, 1871, starved Paris capitulated. But with honours unprecedented in the history of war. The forts were surrendered, the city wall stripped of guns, the weapons of the regiments of the line and of the Mobile Guard were handed over, and they themselves considered prisoners of war. But the National Guard kept its weapons and guns, and only entered into an armistice with the victors. And these did not dare enter Paris in triumph. They only dared to occupy a tiny corner of Paris, which, into the bargain, consisted partly o f public parks, and even this they only occupied for a few days! And during this time they, who had maintained their encirclement of Paris for 131 days, were themselves encircled by the armed workers of Paris, who kept a sharp watch that no \"Prussian\" should overstep the narrow bounds of the corner ceded to the foreign conqueror. Such was the respect which the Paris workers inspired in the army before which all the armies of the empire had laid down their arms; and the Prussian Junkers, who had come to take revenge at the home of the revolution, were compelled to stand by respectfully, and salute precisely this armed revolution !\n\n During the war the Paris workers had confined themselves to demanding the vigorous prosecution of the fight. But now, when peace had come after the capitulation of Paris, now Thiers, the new supreme head of the government, was compelled to realise that the rule of the propertied classes-big landowners and capitalists-was in constant danger so long as the workers of Paris had arms in their hands. His first action was an attempt to disarm them. On March 18, he sent troops of the line with orders to rob the National Guard of the artillery belonging to it, which had been constructed during the siege of Paris and had been paid for by public subscription. The attempt failed: Paris mobilised as one man for resistance, and war between Paris and the French Government sitting at Versailles was declared. On March 26 the Paris Commune was elected and on March 28 it was proclaimed. The Central Committee of the National Guard, which up to then had carried on the government, handed in its resignation to the Commune after it had first decreed the abolition of the scandalous Paris \"Morality Police.\" On March 30 the Commune abolished conscription and the standing army, and declared the sole armed force to be the National Guard, in which all citizens capable of bearing arms were to be enrolled . It remitted all payments of rent for dwelling houses from October 1870 until April, the amounts already paid to be booked as future rent payments, and stopped all sales of articles pledged in the municipal loan office. On the same day the foreigners elected to the Commune were confirmed in office, because \"the flag of the Commune is the flag of the World Republic.\" On April 1 it was decided that the highest salary to be received by any employee of the Commune, and therefore also by its members themselves, was not to exceed 6,000 francs (4, 800 marks). On the following day the Commune decreed the separation of the church from the state, and the abolition of all state payments for religious purposes as well as the transformation o f all church property into national property; as a result of which, on April 8, the exclusion from the schools of all religious symbols, pictures, dogmas, prayers-in a word, \"of all that belongs to the sphere o f the individual's conscience\"-was ordered and gradually put into effect. On the 5th, in reply to the shooting, day after day, of captured Commune fighters by the Versailles troops, a decree was issued for the imprisonment of hostages, but it was never carried into execution. On the 6th, the guillotine was brought out by the 137th battalion of the National Guard, and publicly burnt, amid great popular rejoicing. On the 12th, the Commune decided that the Victory Column on the Place Vend\u00f4me, which had been cast from captured guns by Napoleon after the war of 1809, should be demolished as a symbol of chauvinism and incitement to national hatred. This was carried out on May 16. On April 16 it ordered a statistical tabulation of factories which had been closed down by the manufacturers, and the working out of plans for the operation of these factories by the workers formerly employed in them, who were to be organised in co-operative societies, and also plans for the organisation of these co-operatives in one great union. On the 20th it abolished night work for bakers, and also the employment offices, which since the Second Empire had been run as a monopoly by creatures appointed by the police-labour exploiters of the first rank; these offices were transferred to the mayoralties of the twenty arrondissements of Paris. On April 30 it ordered the closing of the pawnshops, on the ground that they were a private exploitation of the workers, and were in contradiction with the right of the workers to their instruments of labour and to credit. On May 5 it ordered the razing of the Chapel of Atonement, which had been built in expiation of the execution of Louis XVI.\n\n Thus from March 18 onwards the class character of the Paris movement, which had previously been pushed into the background by the fight against the foreign invaders, emerged sharply and clearly. As almost only workers, or recognised representatives of the workers, sat in the Commune, its decisions bore a decidedly proletarian character. Either these decisions decreed reforms which the republican bourgeoisie had failed to pass solely out of cowardice, but which proveded a necessary basis for the free activity of the working class-such as the realisation of the principle that in relation to the state, religion is a purely private matter-or the Commune promulgated decrees which were in the direct interest of the working class and in part cut deeply into the old order of society. In a beleaguered city, however, it was possible to make at most a start in the realisation of all this . And from the beginning of May onwards all their energies were taken up by the fight against the armies assembled by the Versailles government in ever-growing numbers.\n\n On April 7 the Versailles troops had captured the Seine crossing at Neuilly, on the western front of Paris; on the other hand, in an attack on the southern front on the 11th they were repulsed with heavy losses by General Eudes. Paris was continually bombarded and, moreover, by the very people who had stigmatised as a sacrilege the bombardment of the same city by the Prussians. These same people now begged the Prussian government for the hasty return of the French soldiers taken prisoner at Sedan and Metz, in order that they might recapture Paris for them. From the beginning of May the gradual arrival of these troops gave the Versailles forces a decided superiority. This already became evident when, on April 23, Thiers broke off the negotiations for the exchange, proposed by the Commune, of the Archbishop of Paris and a whole number of other priests held as hostages in Paris, for only one man, Blanqui, who had twice been elected to the Commune but was a prisoner in Clairvaux. And even more from the changed language of Thiers; previously procrastinating and equivocal, he now suddenly became insolent, threatening, brutal. The Versailles forces took the redoubt of Moulin Saquet on the southern front, on May 3; on the 9th , Fort Issy, which had been completely reduced to ruins by gunfire; on the 14th, Fort Vanves. On the western front they advanced gradually, capturing the numerous villages and buildings which extended up to the city wall, until they reached the main defences; on the 21st, thanks to treachery and the carelessness of the National Guards stationed there, they succeeded in forcing their way into the city. The Prussians, who held the northern and eastern forts, allowed the Versailles troops to advance across the land north of the city, which was forbidden ground to them under the armistice, and thus to march forward, attacking on a wide front, which the Parisians naturally thought covered by the armistice, and therefore held only weakly. As a result of this, only a weak resistance was put up in the western half of Paris, in the luxury city proper; it grew stronger and more tenacious the nearer the incoming troops approached the eastern half, the working-class city proper. It was only after eight days' fighting that the last defenders of the Commune succumbed on the heights of Belleville and Menilmontant; and then the massacre of defenceless men, women and children, which had been raging all through the week on an increasing scale, reached its zenith. The breechloaders could no longer kill fast enough; the vanquished were shot down in hundreds by mitrailleuse3 fire. The \"Wall of the Federals\" at the Pere Lachaise cemetery, where the final mass murder was consummated, is still standing today, a mute but eloquent testimony to the frenzy of which the ruling class is capable as soon as the working class dares to stand up for its rights. Then, when the slaughter of them all proved to be impossible, came the mass arrests, the shooting of victims arbitrarily selected from the prisoners' ranks, and the removal of the rest to great camps where they awaited trial by courts-martial. The Prussian troops surrounding the northeastern half of Paris had orders not to allow any fugitives to pass; but the officers often shut their eyes when the soldiers paid more obedience to the dictates o f humanity than to those of the Supreme Command; particular honour is due to the Saxon army corps, which behaved very humanely and let through many who were obviously fighters for the Commune.\n\n If today, after twenty years, we look back at the activity and historical significance of the Paris Commune of 1871, we shall find it necessary to make a few additions to the account given in The Civil War in France.\n\n The members of the Commune were divided into a majority, the Blanquists, who had also been predominant in the Central Committee of the National Guard; and a minority, members of the International Working Men's Association, chiefly consisting of adherents of the Proudhon school of socialism. The great majority of the Blanquists were at that time Socialists only by revolutionary, proletarian instinct; only a few had attained greater clarity on principles, through Vaillant, who was familiar with German scientific socialism. It is therefore comprehensible that in the economic sphere much was left undone which, according to our view today, the Commune ought to have done. The hardest thing to understand is certainly the holy awe with which they remained standing respectfully outside the gates of the Bank of France. This was also a serious political mistake. The bank in the hands of the Communethis would have been worth more than ten thousand hostages. It would have meant the pressure of the whole of the French bourgeoisie on the Versailles government in favour of peace with the Commune. But what is still more wonderful is the correctness of much that nevertheless was done by the Commune, composed as it was of Blanquists and Proudhonists. Naturally, the Proudhonists were chiefly responsible for the economic decrees of the Commune, both for their praiseworthy and their unpraiseworthy aspects; as the Blanquists were for its political commissions and omissions. And in both cases the irony of history willed-as is usual when doctrinaires come to the helm-that both did the opposite of what the doctrines of their school prescribed.\n\n Proudhon, the Socialist of the small peasant and mastercraftsman, regarded association with positive hatred. He said of it that there was more bad than good in it; that it was by nature sterile, even harmful, because it was a fetter on the freedom of the worker; that it was a pure dogma, unproductive and burdensome, in conflict as much with the freedom of the worker as with economy of labour; that its disadvantages multiplied more swiftly than its advantages; that, as compared with it, competition, division of labour and private property were economic forces. Only in the exceptional cases-as Proudhon called them-of large-scale industry and large establishments, such as railways, was the association of workers in place. (See General Idea of the Revolution, 3th sketch.)\n\n By 1871, large-scale industry had already so much ceased to be an exceptional case even in Paris, the centre of artistic handicrafts, that by far the most important decree of the Commune instituted an organisation of large-scale industry and even of manufacture which was not only to be based on the association of the workers in each factory, but also to combine all these associations in one great union; in short, an organisation which, as Marx quite rightly says in The Civil War, must necessarily have led in the end to communism, that is to say, the direct opposite of the Proudhon doctrine. And, therefore, the Commune was the grave of the Proudhon school of socialism. Today this school has vanished from French working-class circles; here, among the Possibilists no less than among the \"Marxists,\" Marx's theory now rules unchallenged. Only among the \"radical\" bourgeoisie are there still Proudhonists.\n\n The Blanquists fared no better. Brought up in the school of conspiracy, and held together by the strict discipline which went with it, they started out from the viewpoint that a relatively small number of resolute, well-organised men would be able, at a given favourable moment, not only to seize the helm of state, but also by a display of great, ruthless energy, to maintain power until they succeeded in sweeping the mass of the people into the revolution and ranging them round the small band of leaders. This involved, above all, the strictest, dictatorial centralisation of all power in the hands of the new revolutionary government. And what did the Commune, with its majority of these same Blanquists, actually do? In all its proclamations to the French in the provinces, it appealed to them to form a free federation of all French Communes with Paris, a national organisation which for the first time was really to be created by the nation itself. It was precisely the oppressing power of the former centralised government, army, political police, bureaucracy, which Napoleon had created in 1798 and which since then had been taken over by every new government as a welcome instrument and used against its opponents-it was precisely this power which was to fall everywhere, just as it had already fallen in Paris.\n\n From the very outset the Commune was compelled to recognize that the working class, once come to power, could not go on managing with the old state machine; that in order not to lose again its only just conquered supremacy, this working class must, on the one hand, do away with all the old repressive machinery previously used against it itself, and, on the other, safeguard itself against its own deputies and officials, by declaring them all, without exception, subject to recall at any moment. What had been the characteristic attribute of the former state? Society had created its own organs to look after its common interests, originally through simple division of labour. But these organs, at whose head was the state power, had in the course of time, in pursuance of their own special interests, transformed themselves from the servants of society into the masters of society. This can be seen, for example, not only in the hereditary monarchy, but equally so in the democratic republic. Nowhere do \"politicians\" form a more separate and powerful section of the nation than precisely in North America. \"There, each of the two major parties which alternately succeed each other in power is itself in turn controlled by people who make a business of politics, who speculate on seats in the legislative assemblies of the Union as well as of the separate states, or who make a living by carrying on agitation for their party and on its victory are rewarded with positions. It is well known how the Americans have been trying for thirty years to shake off this yoke, which has become intolerable, and how in spite of it all they continue to sink ever deeper in this swamp of corruption. It is precisely in America that we see best how there takes place this process of the state power making itself independent in relation to society, whose mere instrument it was originally intended to be. Here there exists no dynasty; no nobility, no standing army, beyond the few men keeping watch on the Indians, no bureaucracy with permanent posts or the right to pensions. And nevertheless we find here two great gangs of political speculators, who alternately take possession of the state power and exploit it by the most corrupt means and for the most corrupt ends-and the nation is powerless against these two great cartels of politicians, who are ostensibly its servants, but in reality dominate and plunder it.\n\n Against this transformation of the state and the organs of the state from servants of society into masters of society-an inevitable trans formation in all previous states-the Commune made use of two infallible means . In the first place, it filled all posts-administrative, judicial and educational-by election on the basis of universal suffrage of all concerned, subject to the right of recall at any time by the same electors. And, in the second place, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by other workers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was 6,000 francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting and careerism was set up, even apart from the binding mandates to delegates to representative bodies which were added besides.\n\n\n[Sprengung] of the former state power and its replacement by a new and truly democratic one is described in detail in the third section of The Civil War. But it was necessary to dwell briefly here once more on some of its features, because in Germany particularly the superstitious belief in the state has been carried over from philosophy into the general consciousness of the bourgeoisie and even of many workers. According to the philosophical conception, the state is the \"realisation of the idea,\" or the Kingdom of God on earth, translated into philosophical terms, the sphere in which eternal truth and justice is or should be realised . And from this follows a superstitious reverence for the state and everything connected with it, which takes root the more readily since people are accustomed from child hood to imagine that the affairs and interests common to the whole of society could not be looked after otherwise than as they have been looked after in the past, that is, through the state and its lucratively positioned officials. And people think they have taken quite an extraordinarily bold step forward when they have rid themselves of belief in hereditary monarchy and swear by the democratic republic. In reality, however, the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy; and at best an evil inherited by the proletariat after its victorious struggle for class supremacy, whose worst sides the victorious proletariat, just like the Commune, cannot avoid having to lop off at once as much as possible until such time as a generation reared in new, free social conditions is able to throw the entire lumber of the state on the scrap heap.\n\n Of late, the Social-Democratic philistine has once more been filled with wholesome terror at the words: Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorship looks like? Look at the Paris Commune. That was the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.\n\n Friedrich Engels\nLondon, on the twentieth anniversary of the Paris Commune, March 18, 1891\n\n * * *\n\n III\n\n On the dawn of the 18th of March, Paris arose to the thunderburst of \"Vive la Commune!\" What is the Commune, that sphinx so tantalising to the bourgeois mind?\n\n \"The proletarians of Paris,\" said the Central Committee in its manifesto of the 18th March,\"amidst the failures and treasons of the ruling classes, have understood that the hour has struck for them to save the situation by taking into their own hands the direction of public affairs . . . . They have understood that it is their imperious duty and their absolute right to render themselves masters of their own destinies, by seizing upon the governmental power.\" But the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.\n\n The centralised State power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, police, bureaucracy, clergy, and judicature-organs wrought after the plan of a systematic and hierarchic division of labour,-originates from the days of absolute monarchy, serving nascent middle-class society as a mighty weapon in its struggles against feudalism. Still, its development remained clogged by all manner of mediaeval rubbish, seignorial rights, local privileges, municipal and guild monopolies and provincial constitutions. The gigantic broom of the French Revolution of the eighteenth century swept away all these relics of bygone times, thus clearing simultaneously the social soil of its last hindrances to the superstructure of the modern State edifice raised under the First Empire, itself the offspring of the coalition wars of old semi-feudal Europe against modern France. During the subsequent r\u00e9gimes the Government, placed under parliamentary control-that is, under the direct control of the propertied classes-became not only a hotbed of huge national debts and crushing taxes; with its irresistible allurements of place, pelf, and patronage, it became not only the bone of contention between the rival factions and adventurers of the ruling classes; but its political character changed simultaneously with the economic changes of society. At the same pace at which the progress of modern industry developed, widened, intensified the class antagonism between capital and labour, the State power assumed more and more the character of the national power of capital over labour, of a public force organised for social enslavement, of an engine of class despotism. After every revolution marking a progressive phase in the class struggle, the purely repressive character of the State power stands out in bolder and bolder relief. The Revolution of 1830, resulting in the transfer of Government from the landlords to the capitalists, transferred it from the more remote to the more direct antagonists of the working men. The bourgeois Republicans, who, in the name of the Revolution of February, took the State power, used it for the June massacres, in order to convince the working class that \"social\" republic meant the Republic ensuring their social subjection, and in order to convince the royalist bulk of the bourgeois and landlord class that they might safely leave the cares and emoluments of Government to the bourgeois \"Republicans.\" However, after their one heroic exploit of June, the bourgeois Republicans had, from the front, to fall back to the rear of the \"Party of Order\"-a combination formed by all the rival fractions and factions of the appropriating class in their now openly declared antagonism to the producing classes. The proper form of their joint-stock Government was the Parliamentary Republic, with Louis Bonaparte for its President. Theirs was a r\u00e9gime of avowed class terrorism and deliberate insult toward the \"vile multitude.\" If the Parliamentary Republic, as M. Thiers said, \"divided them (the different fractions of the ruling class) least,\"it opened an abyss between that class and the whole body of society outside their spare ranks. The restraints by which their own divisions had under former r\u00e9gime still checked the State power, were removed by their union; and in view of the threatening upheaval of the proletariat, they now used that State power mercilessly and ostentatiously as the national war-engine of capital against labour. In their uninterrupted crusade against the producing masses they were, however, bound not only to invest the executive with continually increased powers of repression, but at the same time to divest their own parliamentary stronghold-the National Assembly-one by one, of all its own means of defence against the Executive. The Executive, in the person of Louis Bonaparte, turned them out. The natural offspring of the \"Party-of-Order\" Republic was the Second Empire.\n\n The empire, with the coup d'\u00e9tat for its certificate of birth, universal suffrage for its sanction, and the sword for its sceptre, professed to rest upon the peasantry, the large mass of producers not directly involved in the struggle of capital and labour. It professed to save the working class by breaking down Parliamentarism, and, with it, the undisguised subserviency of Government to the propertied classes. It professed to save the propertied classes by upholding their economic supremacy over the working class; and, finally, it professed to unite all classes by reviving for all the chimera of national glory. In reality, it was the only form of government possible at a time when the bourgeoisie had already lost, and the working class had not yet acquired, the faculty of ruling the nation. It was acclaimed throughout the world as the saviour of society. Under its sway, bourgeois society, freed from political cares, attained a development unexpected even by itself. Its industry and commerce expanded to colossal dimensions; financial swindling celebrated cosmopolitan orgies; the misery of the masses was set off by a shameless display of gorgeous, meretricious and debased luxury. The State power, apparently soaring high above society, was at the same time itself the greatest scandal of that society and the very hotbed of all its corruptions. Its own rottenness, and the rottenness of the society it had saved, were laid bare by the bayonet of Prussia, herself eagerly bent upon transferring the supreme seat of that r\u00e9gime from Paris to Berlin. Imperialism is, at the same time, the most prostitute and the ultimate form of the State power which nascent middle- class society had commenced to elaborate as a means of its own emancipation from feudalism, and which full-grown bourgeois society had finally transformed into a means for the enslavement of labour by capital.\n\n The direct antithesis to the empire was the Commune. The cry of \"social republic,\" with which the revolution of February was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did but express a vague aspiration after a Republic that was not only to supersede the monarchical form of class-rule, but class-rule itself. The Commune was the positive form of that Republic.\n\n Paris, the central seat of the old governmental power, and, at the same time, the social stronghold of the French working class, had risen in arms against the attempt of Thiers, and the Rurals to restore and perpetuate that old governmental power bequeathed to them by the empire. Paris could resist only because, in consequence of the siege, it had got rid of the army, and replaced it by a National Guard, the bulk of which consisted of working men. This fact was now to be transformed into an institution. The first decree of the Commune, therefore, was the suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people.\n\n The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class. The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same time. Instead of continuing to be the agent of the Central Government, the police was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible and at all times revocable agent of the Commune. So were the officials of all other branches of the Administration. From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workmen's wages. The vested interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of State disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves. Public functions ceased to be the private property of the tools of the Central Government. Not only municipal administration, but the whole initiative hitherto exercised by the State was laid into the hands of the Commune.\n\n Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the physical force elements of the old Government, the Commune was anxious to break the spiritual force of repression, the \"parsonpower,\" by the disestablishment and disendowment of all churches as proprietary bodies. The priests were sent back to the recesses of private life, there to feed upon the alms of the faithful in imitationof their predecessors, the Apostles. The whole of the educational institutions were opened to the people gratuitously, and at the same time cleared of all interference of Church and State. Thus, not only was education made accessible to all, but science itself freed from the fetters which class prejudice and governmental force had imposed upon it.\n\n The judicial functionaries were to be divested of that sham independence which had but served to mask their abject subserviency to all succeeding governments to which, in turn, they had taken, and broken, the oaths of allegiance. Like the rest of public servants, magistrates and judges were to be elective, responsible, and revocable.\n\n The Paris Commune was, of course, to serve as a model to all the great industrial centres of France. The communal r\u00e9gime once established in Paris and the secondary centres, the old centralised Government would in the provinces, too, have to give way to the self-government of the producers. In a rough sketch of national organisation which the Commune had no time to develop, it states clearly that the Commune was to be the political form of even the smallest country hamlet, and that in the rural districts the standing army was to be replaced by a national militia, with an extremely short term of service. The rural communes of every district were to ad minister their common affairs by an assembly of delegates in the central town, and these district assemblies were again to send deputies to the National Delegation in Paris, each delegate to be at any time revocable and bound by the mandat imp\u00e9ratif (formal instructions) of his constituents. The few but important functions which still would remain for a central government were not to be suppressed, as has been intentionally mis-stated, but were to be discharged by Communal, and therefore strictly responsible agents. The unity of the nation was not to be broken, but, on the contrary, to be organised by the Communal Constitution and to become a reality by the destruction of the State power which claimed to be the embodiment of that unity independent of, and superior to, the nation itself, from which it was but a parasitic excrescence. While the merely repressive organs of the old governmental power were to be amputated, its legitimate functions were to be wrested from an authority usurping pre-eminence over society itself, and restored to the responsible agents of society. Instead of deciding once in three or six years which member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the people, constituted in the Communes, as individual suffrage serves every other employer in the search for the workmen and managers in his business. And it is we11 known that companies, like individuals, in matters of real business generally know how to p u t the right man in the right place, and, if they for once make a mistake, to redress it promptly. On the other hand, nothing could be more foreign to the spirit o f the Commune that to supersede universal suffrage by hierarchic investiture.\n\n It is general1y the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterpart of older and even defunct forms of social life, to which they may bear a certain likeness. Thus, this new Commune, which breaks the modern State power, has been mistaken for a reproduction of the mediaeval Communes, which first preceded, and afterwards became the substratum of, that very State power. The Communal Constitution has been mistaken for an attempt to break up into a federation of sma11 States, as dreamt of by Montesquieu and the Girondins, that unity of great nations which, if originally brought about by political force, has now become a powerful coefficient of social production. The antagonism of the Commune against the State power has been mistaken for an exaggerated form of the ancient struggle against over-centralisation. Peculiar historical circumstances may have prevented the classical development, as in France, of the bourgeois form of government, and may have allowed, as in England, to complete the great central State organs by corrupt vestries, jobbing councillors, and ferocious poor-law guardians in the towns, and virtually hereditary magist rates in the counties. The Communal Constitution would have restored to the social body all the forces hitherto absorbed by the State parasite feeding upon, and clogging the free movement of, society. By this one act it would have initiated the regeneration of France. The provincial French middle class saw in the Commune an attempt to restore the sway their order had held over the country under Louis Philippe, and which, under Louis Napoleon, was supplanted by the pretended rule of the country over the towns. In reality, the Communal Constitution brought the rural producers under the intellectual lead of the central towns of their districts, and these secured to them, in the working men, the natural trustees of their interests. The very existence of the Commune involved, as a matter of course, local municipal liberty, but no longer as a check upon the, now superseded, State power. It could only enter into the head of a Bismarck, who, when not engaged on his intrigues of blood and iron, always likes to resume his old trade, so befitting his mental calibre, of contributor to Kladderadatsch ( the Berlin Punch ), it could only enter into such a head, to ascribe to the Paris Commune aspirations after that caricature of the old French municipal organisation of 1791, the Prussian municipal constitution which degrades the town governments to mere secondary wheels in the police-machinery of the Prussian State. The Commune made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions, cheap government, a reality, by destroying the two greatest sources of expenditure-the standing army and State functionarism. Its very existence presupposed the non-existence of monarchy, which, in Europe at least, is the normal incumbrance and indispensable cloak of class-rule. It supplied the Republic with the basis of really democratic institutions. But neither cheap Government nor the \"true Republic\" was its ultimate aim; they were its mere concomitants.\n\n The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been subjected, and the multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favour, show that it was a thoroughly expansive political form, while all previous forms of government had been emphatically repressive. Its true secret was this. It was essentially a working-class government, the produce of the struggle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economic emancipation of labour.\n\n Except on this last condition, the Communal Constitution would have been an impossibility and a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannot coexist with the perpetuation of his social slavery. The Commune was therefore to serve as a lever for uprooting the economical foundations upon which rests the existence of classes, and therefore of class-rule. With labour emancipated, every man becomes a working man, and productive labour ceases to be a class attribute.\n\n It is a strange fact. In spite of all the tall talk and all the immense literature, for the last sixty years, about Emancipation of Labour, no sooner do the working men anywhere take the subject into their own hands with a will, than uprises at once all the apologetic phraseology of the mouthpieces of present society with its two poles of Capital and Wages Slavery ( the landlord now is but the sleeping partner of the capitalist ), as if capitalist society was still in its purest state of virgin innocence, with its antagonisms still undeveloped, with its delusions still unexploded, with its prostitute realities not yet laid bare. The Commune, they exclaim, intends to abolish property, the basis of all civilisation! Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class-property which makes the labour of the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production, land and capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labour, into mere instruments of free and associated labour.-But this is Communism, \"impossible\" Communism! Why, those members of the ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system-and they are many-have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-operative production. If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to supersede the Capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon a common plan, thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of Capitalist production-what else, gentlemen, would it be but Communism, \"possible\" Communism?\n\n The working class did not expect miracles from the Commune. They have no ready-made utopias to introduce par d\u00e9cret du people. They know that in order to work out their own emancipation, and along with it that higher form to which present society is irresistibly tending by its own economical agencies, they will have to pass through long struggles, through a series of historic processes, transforming circumstances and men. They have no ideals to realise, but to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsing bourgeois society itself is pregnant. In the full consciousness of their historic mission, and with the heroic resolve to act up to it, the working class can afford to smile at the coarse invective of the gentlemen's gentlemen with the pen and inkhorn , and at the didactic patronage of well-wishing bourgeois-doctrinaires, pouring forth their ignorant platitudes and sectarian crotchets in the oracular tone of scientific infallibility.\n\n When the Paris Commune took the management of the revolution in its own hands; when plain working men for the first time dared to infringe upon the Governmental privilege of their \"natural superiors,\" and, under circumstances of u nexampled difficulty, performed their work modestly, conscientiously, and efficiently, performed it at salaries the highest of which barely amounted to one-fifth of what, according to high scientific authority,4 is the minimum required for a secretary to a certain metropolitan school board,-the old world writhed in convulsions of rage at the sight of the Red Flag, the symbol of the Republic of Labour, floating over the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\n\n And yet, this was the first revolution in which the working class was openly acknowledged a s the only class capable o f social initiative, even by the great bulk of the Paris middle class-shopkeepers, tradesmen, merchants-the wealthy capitalists alone excepted. The Commune had saved them by a sagacious settlement of that ever-recurring cause of dispute among the middle classes themselves-the debtor and creditor accounts.5 The same portion of the middle class, after they had assisted in putting down the working men' s insurrection of June, 1848, had been at once unceremoniously sacrificed to their creditors by the then Constituent Assembly. But this was not their only motive for now rallying round the working class. They felt that there was but one alternative-the Commune, or the Empire-under whatever name it might reappear. The Empire had ruined them economically by the havoc it made of public wealth, by the wholesale financial swindling it fostered, by the props it lent to the artificially accelerated centralisation of capital, and the concomitant expropriation of their own ranks. It had suppressed them politically, it had shocked them morally by its orgies, it had insulted their Voltairianism by handing over the education of their children to the fr\u00e9res Ignorantins, it had revolted their national feeling as Frenchmen by precipitating them headlong into a war which left only one equivalent for the ruins it made-the disappearance of the Empire. In fact, after the exodus from Paris of the high Bonapartist and capitalist boh\u00e8me, the true middle-class Party of Order came out in the shape of the \"Union R\u00e8publicaine,\" enrolling themselves under the colours of the Commune and defending it against the wilful misconstruction of Thiers. Whether the gratitude of this great body of the middle class will stand the present severe trial, time must show.\n\n The Commune was perfectly right in telling the peasants that \"its victory was their only hope.\" Of all the lies hatched at Versailles and re-echoed by the glorious European penny-a-liner, one of the most tremendous was that the Rurals represented the French peasantry. Think only of the love of the French peasant for the men to whom, after 1815, he had to pay the milliard of indemnity. In the eyes of the French peasant, the very existence of a great landed proprietor is in itself an encroachment on his conquests of 1789. The bourgeois, in 1848, had burdened his plot of land with the additional tax of forty-five cents in the franc; but then he did so in the name of the revolution; while now he had fomented a civil war against the revolution, to shift on to the peasant's shoulders the chief load of the five milliards of indemnity to be paid to the Prussian. The Commune, on the other hand, in one of its first proclamations, declared that the true originators of the war would be made to pay its cost. The Commune would have delivered the peasant of the blood tax,-would have given him a cheap government,-transformed his present blood-suckers, the notary, advocate, executor, and other judicial vampires, into salaried communal agents, elected by, and responsible to, himself. It would have freed him of the tyranny of the garde champ\u00eatre, the gendarme, and the prefect; would have put enlightenment by the schoolmaster in the place of stultification by the priest. And the French peasant is, above all, a man of reckoning. He would find it extremely reasonable that the pay of the priest, instead of being extorted by the taxgatherer, should only depend upon the spontaneous action of the parishioners' religious instincts. Such were the great immediate boons which the rule of the Commune-and that rule alone-held out to the French peasantry. It is, therefore, quite superfluous here to expatiate upon the more complicated but vital problems which the Commune alone was able, and at the same time compelled, to solve in favour of the peasant, viz., the hypothecary debt, lying like an incubus upon his parcel of soil, the prol\u00e9tariat foncier ( the rural proletariat ), daily growing upon it, and his expropriation from it enforced, at a more and more rapid rate, by the very development of modern agriculture and the competition of capitalist farming.\n\n The French peasant had elected Louis Bonaparte president of the Republic; but the Party of Order created the Empire. What the French peasant really wants he commenced to show in 1849 and 1850, by opposing his maire to the Governmen t's prefect, his schoolmaster to the Government's priest, and himself to the Government's gendarme. All the laws made by the Party of Order in January and February, 1850\" were avowed measures of repression against the peasant. The peasant was a Bonapartist, because the great Revolution, with all its benefits to him, was, in his eyes, personified in Napoleon. This delusion, rapid ly breaking down under the Second Empire (and in its very nature hostile to the Rurals ), this prejudice of the past, how could it have withstood the appeal of the Commune to the living interests and urgent wants of the peasantry?\n\n The Rurals-this was, in fact, their chief apprehension-knew that three months' free communication of Communal Paris with the provinces would bring about a general rising o f the peasants, and hence their anxiety to establish a police blockade around Paris, so as to stop the spread of the rinderpest.\n\n If the Commune was thus the true representative of all the healthy elements of French' society, and therefore the truly national Government, it was, at the same time, as a working men's Government, as the bold champion of the emancipation of labour, emphatically international. Within sight of the Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two French provinces, the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world.\n\n The Second Empire had been the jubilee o f cosmopolitan blacklegism, the rakes of all countries rushing in at its call for a share in its orgies and in the plunder of the French people. Even at this moment the right hand of Thiers is Ganesco, the foul Wallachian, and his left hand is Markovsky, the Russian spy, The Commune admitted all foreigners to the honour of dying for an immortal cause. Between the foreign war lost by their treason, and the civil war fomented by their conspiracy with the foreign invader, the bourgeoisie had found the time to display their patriotism by organizing police-hunts upon the Germans in France. The Commune made a German working man its Minister of Labour. Thiers, the bourgeoisie, the Second Empire, had continually deluded Poland by loud professions of sympathy, while in reality betraying her to, and doing the dirty work of, Russia. The Commune honoured the heroic sons of Poland by placing them at the head of the defenders of Paris. And, to broadly mark the new era of history it was conscious of initiating, under the eyes of the conquering Prussians, on the one side, and of the Bonapartist army, led by Bonapartist generals, on the other, the Commune pulled down that colossal symbol of martial glory, the Vend\u00f4me column.\n\n The great social measure of the Commune was its own working existence. Its special measures could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by the people. Such were the abolition of the nightwork of journeymen bakers; the prohibition, under penalty, of the employers' practice to reduce wages by levying upon their work-people fines under manifold pretexts,-a process in which the employer combines in his own person the parts of legislator, judge, and executor, and filches the money to boot. Another measure of this class was the surrender, to associations of workmen, under reserve of compensation, of all closed workshops and factories, no matter whether the respective capitalists had absconded or preferred to strike work.\n\n The financial measures of the Commune, remarkable for their sagacity and moderation, could only be such as were compatible with the state of a beseiged town. Considering the colossal robberies committed upon the city of Paris by the great financial companies and contractors, under the protection of Haussmann,6 the Commune would have had an incomparably better title to confiscate their property than Louis Napoleon had against the Orleans family. The Hohenzollern and the English oligarchs, who both have derived a good deal of their estates from Church plunder, were, of course, greatly shocked at the Commune clearing but 8,000 f. out of secularisation.\n\n While the Versailles Government, as soon as it had recovered some spirit and strength, used the most violent means against the Commune; while it put down the free expression of opinion all over France, even to the forbidding of meetings of delegates from the large towns;' while it subjected Versailles and the rest of France to an espionage far surpassing that of the Second Empire; while it burned by its gendarme inquisitors all papers printed at Paris, and sifted all correspondence from and to Paris; while in the National Assembly the most timid attempts to put in a word for Paris were howled down in a manner unknown even to the Chambre introuvable of 1816; with the savage warfare of Versailles outside, and its attempts at corruption and conspiracy inside Paris-would the Commune not have shamefully betrayed its trust by affecting to keep up all the decencies and appearances of liberalism as in a time of profound peace? Had the Government of the Commune been akin to that of M. Thiers, there would have been no more occasion to suppress Party-of-Order papers at Paris than there was to suppress Communal papers at Versailles.\n\n It was irritating indeed to the Rurals that at the very same time they declared the return to the church to be the only means of salvation for France, the infidel Commune unearthed the peculiar mysteries of the Picpus nunnery, and of the Church of Saint Laurent. It was a satire upon M. Thiers that, while he showered grand crosses upon the Bonapartist generals in acknowledgement of their mastery in losing battles, signing capitulations, and turning cigarettes at Wilhelmsh\u00f6he, the Commune dismissed and arrested its generals whenever they were suspected of neglecting their duties. The explusion from, and arrest by, the Commune of one of its members who had slipped in under a false name, and had undergone at Lyons six days' imprisonment for simple bankruptcy, was it not a deliberate insult hurled a t the forger, Jules Favre, then still the foreign minister of France, still selling France to Bismarck, and still dictating his orders to that paragon Government of Belgium? But indeed the Commune did not pretend to infallibility, the invariable attribute of all governments of the old stamp. It published its doings and sayings, it initiated the public into all its shortcomings.\n\n In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of a different stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees to past revolutions, without insight into the present movement, but preserving popular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheer force of tradition; others mere bawlers, who, by dint of repeating year after year the same set of stereotyped declamations against the Government of the day, have sneaked into the reputation of revolutionists of the first water. After the 18th of March, some such men did also turn up, and in some cases contrived to play pre-eminent parts. As far as their power went, they hampered the real action of the working class, exactly as men of that sort have hampered the full development of every previous revolution. They are an unavoidable evil: with time they are shaken off; but time was not allowed to the Commune.\n\n Wonderful, indeed, was the change the Commune had wrought in Paris! No longer any trace of the meretricious Paris of the Second Empire. No longer was Paris the rendezvous of British landlords, Irish absentees, American ex-slaveholders and shoddy men, Russian ex-serf-owners, and Wallachian boyards. No more corpses at the morgue, no nocturnal burglaries, scarcely any robberies; in fact, for the first time since the days of February, 1848, the streets of Paris were safe, and that without any police of any kind . \"We,\" said a member o f the Commune, \"hear no longer of assassination, theft and personal assault; it seems indeed as if the police had dragged along with it to Versailles all its Conservative friends.\" The cocottes had refound the scent o f their protectors-the absconding men of family, religion, and, above all, of property. In their stead, the real women of Paris showed again at the surface-heroic, noble, and devoted, like the women of antiquity. Working, thinking, fighting, bleeding Paris-almost forgetful, in its incubation of a new society, of the cannibals at its gates-radiant in the enthusiasm of its historic intiative!\n\n Opposed to this new world at Paris, behold the old world at Versailles- that assembly of the ghouls of all defunct r\u00e9gimes, Legitimists and Orleanists, eager to feed upon the carcass of the nation,-with a tail of antediluvian Republicans, sanctioning, by their presence in the Asssembly, the slaveholders' rebellion, relying for the maintenance of their Parliamentary Republic upon the vanity of the senile mountebank at its head, and caricaturing 1789 by holding their ghastly meetings in the Jeu de Paume.7 There it was, this Assembly, the representative of everything dead in France, propped up to the semblance of life by nothing but the swords of the generals of Louis Bonaparte. Paris all truth, Versailles all lie; and that lie vented through the mouth of Thiers.\n\n Thiers tells a deputation of the mayors of the Seine-et-Oise,\"You may rely upon my word, which I have never broken!\" He tells the Assembly itself that \"it was the most freely elected and most Liberal Assembly France ever possessed\"; he tells his motley soldiery that it was \"the admiration of the world, and the finest army France ever possessed\"; he tells the provinces that the bombardment of Paris by him was a myth: \" If some cannonshots have been fired, i t is not the deed of the army of Versailles, but of some insurgents trying to make believe that they are fighting, while they dare not show their faces.\" He again tells the provinces that \"the artillery of Versailles does not bombard Paris, but only cannonades it.\" He tells the Archbishop of Paris that the pretended executions and reprisals (!) attributed to the Versailles troops were all moonshine. He tells Paris that he was only anxious \"to free it from the hideous tyrants who oppress it,\" and that, in fact, the Paris of the Commune was \"but a handful of criminals.\"\n\n The Paris o f M. Thiers was not the real Paris of the \"vile multitude,\" but a phantom Paris, the Paris of the francs-fileurs 8 the Paris of the Boulevards, male and female-the rich, the capitalist, the gilded, the idle Paris, now thronging with its lackeys, its black- legs, its literary boh\u00eame, and its cocottes at Versailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil, and Saint-Germain; considering the civil war but an agreeable diversion, eyeing the battle going on H1rough telescopes, counting the rounds of cannon, and swearing by their own honour and that of their prostitutes, that the performance was far better got up than it used to be a t the Porte St. Martin. The men who fell were really dead; the cries of the wounded were cries in good earnest; and, besides, the whole thing was so intensely historical.\n\n This is the Paris of M. Thiers, as the emigration of Coblenz was the France of M. de Calonne.\n\n IV\n\n The first attempt of the slaveholders' conspiracy to put down Paris by getting the Prussians to occupy it, was frustrated by Bismarck's refusal. The second attempt, that of the 1 8th of March, ended in the rout of the army and the flight to Versailles of the Government, which ordered the whole administration to break up and follow in its track. By the semblance of peace-negotiations with\nParis, Thiers found the time to prepare for war against it. But where to find an army? The remnants of the line regiments were weak in number and unsafe in character. His urgent appeal to the provinces to succour Versailles, by their National Guards and volunteers, met with a flat refusal. Brittany alone furnished a handful of Chouans fighting under a white flag, every one of them wearing on\nhis breast the heart o f Jesus in white cloth, and shouting \"Vive le Roil\" ( Long live the King! ) Thiers was, therefore, compelled to collect, in hot haste, a motley crew, composed of sailors, marines, Pontifical Zouaves, Valentin's gendarmes, and Pietri's sergents-deville and mouchards. This army, however, would have been ridiculously ineffective without the instalments of imperalist war-prisoners, which Bismarck granted in numbers just sufficient to keep the civil war a-going, and keep the Versailles Government in abject dependence on Prussia. During the war itself, the Versailles police had to look after the Versailles army, while the gendarmes had to drag it on by exposing themselves at all posts of danger. The forts which fell were not taken, but bought. The heroism of the Federals convinced Thiers that the resistance of Paris was not to be broken by his own strategic genius and the bayonets at his disposal.\n\n Meanwhile, his relations with the provinces became more and more difficult. Not one single address of approval came in to gladden Thiers and his Rurals. Quite the contrary. Deputations and addresses demanding, in a tone anything but respectful, conciliation with Paris on the basis of the unequivocal recognition of the Republic, the acknowledgement of the Communal liberties, and the dissolution of the National Assembly, whose mandate was extinct; poured in from all sides, and in such numbers that Dufaure, Thiers' Minister of Justice, in his circular of April 23 to the public prosecutors, commanded them to treat \"the cry of conciliation\" as a crime! In regard, however, of the hopeless prospect held out by his campaign, Thiers resolved to shift his tactics by ordering, all over the country, municipal elections to take place on the 30th of April, on the basis o f the new municipal law dictated by himself to the National Assembly. What with the intrigues of his prefects, what with police intimidation, he felt quite sanguine of imparting, by the verdict of the provinces, to the National Assembly that moral power it had never possessed, and of getting at last from the provinces the physical force required for the conquest of Paris.\n\n His banditti-warfare against Paris, exalted in his own bulletins, and the attempts of his ministers at the establishment, throughout France, of a reign of terror, Thiers was from the beginning anxious to accompany with a little by-play of conciliation, which had to serve more than one purpose. It was to dupe the provinces, to inveiglethe middle-class element in Paris, and, above all, to afford the professed Republicans in the National Assembly the opportunity of hiding their treason against Paris behind their faith in Thiers. On the 21st of March, when still without an army, he had declared to the Assembly: \"Come what may, I will not send an army to Paris.\" On the 27th March he rose again: \"I have found the Republic an accomplished fact, and I am firmly resolved to maintain it.\" In reality, he put down the revolution at Lyons and Marseilles9 in the name of the Republic, while the roars of his Rurals drowned the very mention of its name at Versailles. After this exploit, he toned down the \"accomplished fact\" into a hypothetical fact. The Orleans princes, whom he had cautiously warned off Bordeaux, were now, in flagrant breach of the law, permitted to intrigue at Dreux. The concessions held out by Thiers in his interminable interviews with the delegates from Paris and the provinces, although constantly varied in tone and colour, according to time and circumstances, did in fact never come to more than the prospective restriction of revenge to the \"handful of criminals implicated in the murder of Lecomte and Clement Thomas,\" on the well-understood premise that Paris and France were unreservedly to accept M. Thiers himself as the best of possible Republics, as he, in 1830; had done with Louis Philippe. Even these concessions he not only took care to render doubtful by the official comments put upon them in the Assembly through his Ministers. He had his Dufaure to act. Dufaure, this old Orleanist lawyer, had always been the justiciary of the state of siege, as now in 1871, under Thiers, so in 1839 under Louis Philippe, and in 1849 under Louis Bonaparte's presidency. While out of office he made a fortune by pleading for the Paris capitalists, and made political capital by pleading against the laws he had himself originated. He now hurried through the National Assembly not only a set of repressive laws which were, after the fall of Paris, to extirpate the last remnants of Republican liberty in France; he foreshadowed the fate of Paris by abridging the, for him, too slow procedure of courts-martial, and by a new-fangled, Draconic code of deportation. The Revolution of 1848, abolishing the penalty of death for political crimes, has replaced it by deportation. Louis Bonaparte did not dare, at least not in theory, to re-establish the r\u00e9gime of the guillotine. The Rural Assembly, not yet bold enough even to hint that the Parisians were not rebels, but assassins, had therefore to confine its prospective vengeance against Paris to Dufaure's new code of deportation. Under all these circumstances Thiers himself could not have gone on with his comedy of conciliation, had it not, as he intended it to do, drawn forth shrieks of rage from the Rurals, whose ruminating mind did neither understand the play, nor its necessities of hypocrisy, tergiversation, and procrastination.\n\n In sight of the impending municipal elections of the 30th April, Thiers enacted one of his great conciliation scenes on the 27th April. Amidst a flood of sentimental rhetoric, he exclaimed from the tribune of the Assembly: \"There exists no conspiracy against the Republic but that of Paris, which compels us to shed French blood. I repeat it again and again. Let those impious arms fall from the hands which hold them, and chastisement will be arrested at once by an act of peace excluding only the small number of criminals.\" To the violent interruption of the Rurals he replied: \"Gentlemen, tell me, I implore you, am I wrong? Do you really regret that I could have stated the truth that the criminals are only a handful? Is it not fortunate in the midst of our misfortunes that those who have been capable to shed the blood of Clement Thomas and General Lecomte are but rare exceptions?\"\n\n France, however, turned a deaf ear to what Thiers flattered himself to be a parliamentary siren's song. Out of 700,000 municipal councillors returned by the 35,000 communes still left to France, the united Legitimists, Orleanists and Bonapartists did not carry 8,000. The supplementary elections which followed were still more decidedly hostile. Thus, instead of getting from the provinces the Badly-needed physical force, the National Assembly lost even its last claim to moral force, that of being the expression of the universal suffrage of the country. To complete the discomfiture, the newlychosen municipal councils of all the cities of France openly threatened the usurping Assembly at Versailles with a counter Assembly at Bordeaux.\n\n Then the long-expected moment of decisive action had at last come for Bismarck. He peremptorily summoned Thiers to send to Frankfort plenipotentiaries for the definitive settlement of peace. In humble obedience to the call of his master, Thiers hastened to depatch his trusty Jules Favre, backed by Pouyer-Quertier. PouyerQuertier, an \"eminent\" Rouen cotton-spinner, a fervent and even servile partisan of the Second Empire, had never found any fault with it save its commercial treaty with England, prejudicial to his own shop-interest. Hardly installed at Bordeaux as Thiers' Minister of Finance, he denounced that \"unholy\" treaty, hinted at its near abrogation, and had even the effrontery to try, although in vain (having counted without Bismarck), the immediate enforcement of he old protective duties against Alsace, where, he said, no previous international treaties stood in the way. This man, who considered counter revolution as a means to put down wages at Rouen, and the surrender of French provinces as a means to bring up the price of is wares in France, was he not the one predestined to be picked out by Thiers as the helpmate of Jules Favre in his last and crowning treason?\n\n On the arrival at Frankfort of this exquisite pair of plenipotentiaries, bully Bismarck at once met them with the imperious alternative: Either the restoration of the Empire, or the unconditional acceptance of my own peace terms! These terms included a shortening of the intervals in which the war indemnity was to be paid and the continued occupation of the Paris forts by Prussian troops until Bismarck should feel satisfied with the state of things in France; Prussia thus being recognised as the supreme arbiter in internal French politics! In return for this he offered to let loose, for the extermination of Paris, the captive Bonapartist army, and to lend them the direct assistance of Emperor William's troops. He pledged his good faith by making payment of the first installment of the indemnity dependent on the \"pacification\" of Paris. Such a bait was, of course, eagerly swallowed by Thiers and his plenipotentiaries. They signed the treaty of peace on the 10th of May, and had it endorsed by the Versailles Assembly on the 18th. In the interval between the conclusion of peace and the arrival of the Bonapartist prisoners, Thiers felt the more bound to resume his comedy of conciliation, as his Republican tools stood in sore need of a pretext for blinking their eyes at the preparations for the carnage of Paris. As late as the 8th of May he replied to a deputation of middle-class conciliators: \"Whenever the insurgents will make up their minds for capitulation, the gates of Paris shall be flung wide open during a week for all except the murderers of Generals Clement Thomas and Lecomte.\"\n\n A few days afterwards, when violently interpellated on these promises by the Rurals, he refused to enter into any explanations; not, however, without giving them this significant hint. \"I tell you there are impatient men amongst you, men who are in too great a hurry. They must have another eight days; at the end of these eight days there will be no more danger, and the task will be proportionate to their courage and to their capacities.\" As soon as MacMahon was able to assure him that he could shortly enter Paris, Thiers declared to the Assemblv that \"he would enter Paris with the laws in his hands, and demand a full expiation from the wretches who had sacrificed the lives of soldiers and destroyed public monuments.\" As the moment of decision drew near he said-to the Assembly, \"I shall be pitiless!\"-to Paris, that it was doomed; and to his Bonapartist banditti, that they had State licence to wreak vengeance upon Paris to their hearts' content. At last, when treachery had opened the gates of Paris to General Douay, on the 21st of May, Thiers, on the 22nd, revealed to the Rurals the \u201cgoal\" of his conciliation comedy, which they had so obstinately persisted in not understanding. \"I told you a few days ago that we were approaching our goal; today I come to tell you the goal is reached. The victory of order, justice and civilisation is at last won!\"\n\n So it was. The civilisation and justice of bourgeois order comes out in its lurid light whenever the slaves and drudges of that order rise against their masters. Then this civilisation and justice stand forth as undisguised savagery and lawless revenge. Each new crisis in the class struggle between the appropriator and the producer brings out this fact more glaringly. Even the atrocities of the bourgeois in June, 1848, vanish before the ineffable infamy of 1871. The self-sacrificing heroism with which the population of Paris-men, women and children-fought for eight days after the entrance of the Versaillese, reflects as much the grandeur of their cause, as the infernal deeds of the soldiery reflect the innate spirit of that civilisation of which they are the mercenary vindicators. A glorious civilisation, indeed, the great problem of which is how to get rid of the heaps of corpses it made after the battle was over!\n\n To find a parallel for the conduct of Thiers and his blood-hounds we must go back to the times of Sulla and the two Triumvirates of Rome. The same wholesale slaughter in cold blood; the same disregard, in massacre, of age and sex; the same system of torturing prisoners; the same proscriptions, but this time of a whole class; the same savage hunt after concealed leaders, lest one might escape; the same denunciations of political and private enemies; the same indifference for the butchery of entire strangers to the feud. There is but this difference, that the Romans had no mitrailleuses for the despatch, in the lump, of the proscribed, and that they had not \"the law in their hands,\" nor on their lips the cry of \"civilisation.\"\n\n And after those horrors, look upon the other, still more hideous, face of that bourgeois civilisation as described by its own press!\n\n \"With stray shots,\" writes the Paris correspondent of a London Tory paper, \"still ringing in the distance, and untended wounded wretches dying amid the tombstones of P\u00e8re la Chaise-with 6,000 terror-stricken insurgents wandering in an agony of despair in the labyrinth of the catacombs, and wretches hurried through the streets to be shot down in scores by the mitrailleuse-it is revolting to see the caf\u00e9s filled with the votaries of absinthe , billiards , and dominoes; female profligacy perambulating the boulevards, and the sound of revelry disturbing the night from the cabinets particuliers of fashionable restaurants.\" M. Edouard Herve writes in the Journal de Paris, a Versaillist journal suppressed by the Commune: \"The way in which the population of Paris (!) manifested its satisfaction yesterday was rather more than frivolous, and we fear it will grow worse as time progresses. Paris has now a f\u00eate day appearance, which is sadly out of place; and, unless we are to be called the Parisiens de la decadence, this sort of thing must come to an end.\" And then he quotes the passage from Tacitus : \"Yet, on the morrow of that horrible struggle, even before it was completely over, Romedegraded and corrupt-began once more to wallow in the voluptuous slough which was destroying its body and polluting its soul-alibi proelia et vulnera; alibi balnea popinaeque ( here fights and wounds, there baths and restaurants ).\" M. Herve only forgets to say that the \"population of Paris\" he speaks of is but the population of the Paris of M. Thiers-the francs-fileurs returning in throngs from\nVersailles, Saint-Denis, Rueil and Saint-Germain-the Paris of the \"Decline.\"\n\n In all its bloody triumphs over the self-sacrificing champions of a new and better society, that nefarious civilisation, based upon thezenslavement of labour, drowns the moans of its victims in a hue-and-cry of calumny, reverberated by a worldwide echo. The serene working men's Paris of the Commune is suddenly changed into a pandemonium by the bloodhounds of \"order.\" And what does this tremendous change prove to the bourgeois mind of all countries? Why, that the Commune has conspired against civilisation! The Paris people die enthusiastically for the Commune in numbers unequalled in any battle known to history. What does that prove? Why, that the Commune was not the people's own government but the usurpation of a handful of criminals! The women of Paris joyfully give up their lives at the barricades and on the place of execution. What does this prove? Why, that the demon of the Commune has changed them into Megaeras and Hecates! The moderation of the Commune during two months of undisputed sway is equalled only by the heroism of its defence. What does that prove? Why, that for months the Commune carefully hid, under a mask of moderation and humanity, the blood-thirstiness of its fiendish instincts, to be let loose in the hour of its agony!\n\n The working men's Paris, in the act of its heroic self-holocaust, involved in its flames buildings and monuments. \"'While tearing to pieces the living body of the proletariat, its rulers must no longer expect to return triumphantly into the intact architecture of their abodes. The Government of Versailles cries, \"Incendiarism!\" and whispers this cue to all its agents, down to the remotest hamlet, to hunt up its enemies everywhere as suspect of professional incendiarism. The bourgeoisie of the whole world, which looks complacently upon the wholesale massacre after the battle, is convulsed by horror at the desecration o f brick and mortar !\n\n When governments give state-licences to their navies to \"kill, burn and destroy,\" is that a licence for incendiarism? When the British troops wantonly set fire to the Capitol at Washington and to the summer palace of the Chinese Emperor, was that incendiarism? When the Prussians, not for military reasons, but out of the mere spite of revenge, burned down, by the help of petroleum, towns like Chateaudun and innumerable villages, was that incendiarism? When Thiers, during six weeks, bombarded Paris, under the pretext that he wanted to set fire to those houses only in which there were people, was that incendiarism?-In war, fire is an arm as legitimate as any. Buildings held by the enemy are shelled to set them on fire. If their defenders have to retire, they themselves light the flames to prevent the attack from making use of the buildings. To be burnt down has always been the inevitable fate of all buildings situated in the front of battle of all the regular armies of the world. But in the war of the enslaved against their enslavers, the only\u2022 justifiable war in history, this is by no means to hold good! The Commune used fire strictly as a means of defence. They used it to stop up to the Versailles troops those long, straight avenues which Haussmann had expressly opened to artillery-fire; they used it to cover their retreat, in the same way as the Versaillese, in their advance, used their shells which destroyed at least as many buildings as the fire of the Commune. It is a matter of dispute, even now, which buildings were set fire to by the defence, and which by the attack. And the defence resorted to fire only then, when the Versaillese troops had already commenced their wholesale murdering of prisoners.-Besides, the Commune had, long before, given full public notice that, if driven to extremities, they would bury themselves under the ruins of Paris, and make Paris a second Moscow, as the Government of Defence, but only as a cloak for its treason, had promised to do. For this purpose Trochu had found them the petroleum. The Commune knew that its opponents cared nothing for the lives of the Paris people, but cared much for their own Paris buildings. And Thiers, on the other hand, had given them notice that he would be implacable in his vengeance. No sooner had he got his army ready on one side, and the Prussians shutting up the trap on the other, than he proclaimed: \"I shall be pitiless! The expiation will be complete, and justice will be stern!\" If the acts o f the Paris working men were vandalism, it was the vandalism of defence in despair, not the vandalism of triumph, like that which the Christians perpetrated upon the really priceless art treasures of heathen antiquity; and even that vandalism has been justified by the historian as an unavoidable and comparatively trifling concomitant to the titanic struggle between a new society arising and an old one breaking down. It was still less the vandalism of Haussmann, razing historic Paris to make place for the Paris of the sightseer!\n\n But the execution by the Commune of the sixty-four hostages, with the Archbishop of Paris at their head! The bourgeoisie and its army in June, 1848, re-established a custom which had long disappeared from the practice of war-the shooting of their defenceless prisoners. This brutal custom has since been more or less strictly adhered to by the suppressors of all popular commotions in Europe and India; thus proving that it constitutes a real \"progress of civilisation!\" On the other hand, the Prussians, in France, had re-established the practice of taking hostages-innocent men, who, with their lives, were to answer to them for the acts of others. When Thiers, as we have seen, from the very beginning of the conflict, enforced the humane practice of shooting down the Communal prisoners, the Commune, to protect their lives, was obliged to resort to the Prussian practice of securing hostages. The lives of the hostages had been forfeited over and over again by the continued shooting of prisoners on the part of the Versaillese. How could they be spared any longer after the carnage with which MacMahon's praetorians celebrated their entrance into Paris? Was even the last check upon the unscrupulous ferocity of bourgeois governments the taking of hostages-to be made a mere sham of? The real murderer of Archbishop Darboy is Thiers. The Commune again and again had offered to exchange the archbishop, and ever so many priests in the bargain, against the single Blanqui, then in the hands of Thiers. Thiers obstinately refused. He knew that with Blanqui he would give to the Commune a head; while the archbishop would serve his purpose best in the shape of a corpse. Thiers acted upon the precedent of Cavaignac. How, in June, 1848, did not Cavaignac and his men of order raise shouts of horror by stigmatising the insurgents as the assassins of Archbishop Affre! They knew perfectly well that the archbishop had been shot by the soldiers of order. M. Jacquemet, the archbishop's vicar-general, present on the spot, had immediately afterwards handed them in his evidence to that effect.\n\n All this chorus o f calumny, which the Party of Order never fail, in their orgies of blood, to raise against their victims, only proves that the bourgeois of our days considers himself the legitimate successor to the baron of old, who thought every weapon in his own hand fair against the plebeian, while in the hands of the plebeian a weapon of any kind constituted in itself a crime.\n\n The conspiracy of the ruling class to break down the Revolution by a civil war carried on under the patronage of the foreign invader-a conspiracy which we have traced from the very 4th of September down to the entrance of MacMahon 's praetorians through the gate of St. Cloud-culminated in the carnage of Paris. Bismarck gloats over the ruins o f Paris, in which he saw perhaps the first instalment of that general destruction of great cities he had prayed for when still a simple Rural in the Prussian Chambre introuvable of 1849. He gloats over the cadavers of the Paris proletariat. For him this is not only the extermination of revolution, but the extinction of France, now decapitated in reality, and by the French Government itself. With the shallowness characteristic of all successful statesmen, he sees but the surface of this tremendous historic event. Whenever before has history exhibited the spectacle of a conqueror crowning his victory by turning into, not only the gendarme, but the hired bravo of the conquered Government? There existed\u2022 no war between Prussia and the Commune of Paris. On the contrary, the Commune had accepted the peace preliminaries, and Prussia had announced her neutrality. Prussia was, therefore, no belligerent. She acted the part of a bravo, a cowardly bravo, because incurring no danger; a hired bravo, because stipulating beforehand the payment of her blood-money of 500 millions on the fan of Paris. And thus, at last, came out the true character of the war, ordained by Providence as a chastisement of godless and debauched France by pious and moral Germany! And this unparalled breach of the law of nations, even as understood by the old-world lawyers, instead of arousing the \"civilised\" Governments of Europe to declare the felonious Prussian Government, the mere tool of the St. Petersburg Cabinet, an outlaw amongst nations, only incites them to consider whether the few victims who escape the double cordon around Paris are not to be given up to the hangman at Versailles!\n\n That after the most tremendous war of modern times, the conquering and the conquered hosts should fraternise for the common massacre of the proletariat-this unparalleled event does indicate, not, as Bismarck thinks, the final repression of a new society upheaving, but the crumbling into dust of bourgeois society. The highest heroic effort of which old society is still capable is national war; and this is now proved to be a mere governmental humbug, intended to defer the struggle of classes, and to be thrown aside as soon as that class struggle bursts out into civil war. Class rule is no longer able to disguise itself in a national uniform; the national Governments are one as against the proletariat!\n\n After Whit-Sunday, 1871, there can be neither peace nor truce possible between the working men of France and the appropriators of their produce. The iron hand of a mercenary soldiery may keep for a time both classes tied down in common oppression. But the battle must break out again and again in ever-growing dimensions, and there can be no doubt as to who will be the victor in the end,-the appropriating few, or the immense working majority. And the French working class is only the advanced guard of the modern proletariat.\n\n While the European governments thus testify, before Paris, to the international character of class-rule, they cry down the International Working Men's Association-the international counter-organisation of labour against the cosmopolitan conspiracy of capital -as the head fountain of all these disasters. Thiers denounced it as the despot of labour, pretending to be its liberator. Picard ordered those abroad should be cut off; Count jaubert, Thiers' mummified accomplice of 1835, declares it the great problem of all civilized that all communications between the French Internationals and governments to weed it out. The Rurals roar against it, and the whole European press joins the chorus. An honourable French writer, completely foreign to our Association, speaks as follows: \"The members of the Central Committee of the National Guard, as well as the greater part of the members of the Commune, are the most active, intelligent, and energetic minds of the International Working Men's Association; men who are thoroughly honest, sincere, intelligent, devoted, pure, and fanatical in the good sense of the word. \"The police-tinged bourgeois mind naturally figures to itself the International Working Men's Association as acting in the manner of a secret conspiracy, its central body ordering, from time to time, explosions in different countries. Our Association is, in fact, nothing but the international bond between the most advanced working men in the various countries of the civilised world. Whenever, in whatever shape, and under whatever conditions the class struggle obtains any consistency, it is but natural that members of our Association should stand in the foreground. The soil out of which it grows is modern society itself. It cannot be stamped out by any amount of carnage. To stamp it out, the Governments would have to stamp out the despotism of capital over labour-the condition of their own parasitical existence.\n\n Working men's Paris, with its Commune, will be for ever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all the prayers of their priests will not avail to redeem them.\n\n On Imperialism in India\n\n KARL MARX\n\nMarx's way of analyzing the problems of an Asian society under European imperial rule is reflected in these two articles which he wrote in English for The New York Daily Tribune and which were printed in its issues of June 25 and August 8, 1853. Of special interest in the analysis is the conception he entertained of Oriental despotism as an antique form of class society with a ruling bureaucracy based on large-scale irrigation works. We may note, too, his assumption that it was the fate of non-Western societies like that of India to go the way of bourgeois development as seen in modern Europe.\n\n The British Rule in India\n\n London, Friday, June 10, 1853\n\n Hindostan is an Italy of Asiatic dimensions, the Himalayas for the Alps, the Plains of Bengal for the Plains of Lombardy, the Deccan for the Appenines, and the Isle of Ceylon for the Island of Sicily. The same rich variety in the products of the soil, and the same dismemberment in the political configuration. Just as Italy has, from time to time, been compressed by the conqueror's sword into different national masses, so do we find Hindostan, when not under the pressure of the Mohammedan, or the Mogul, or the Briton, dissolved into as many independent and conflicting States as it numbered towns, or even villages. Yet, in a social point of view, Hindostan is not the Italy, but the Ireland of the East. And this strange combination of Italy and of Ireland, of a world of voluptuousness and of a world of woes, is anticipated in the ancient traditions of the religion of Hindostan. That religion is at once a religion of sensualist exuberance, and a religion of self-torturing asceticism; a religion of the Lingam and of the Juggernaut; the religion of the Monk, and of the Bayadere.\n\n I share not the opinion of those who believe in a golden age of Hindostan, without recurring, however, like Sir Charles Wood, for the confirmation of my view, to the authority of Khuli-Khan. But take, for example, the times of Aurung-Zebe; or the epoch, when the Mogul appeared in the North, and the Portuguese in the South; or the age of Mohammedan invasion, and of the Heptarchy1 in Southern India; or, if you will, go still more back to antiquity, take the mythological chronology of the Brahmin himself, who places the commencement of Indian misery in an epoch even more remote than the Christian creation of the world.\n\n There cannot, however, remain any doubt but that the misery inflicted by the British on Hindostan is of an essentially different and infinitely more intensive kind than all Hindostan had to suffer before. I do not allude to European despotism, planted upon Asiatic despotism, by the British East India Company,2 forming a more monstrous combination than any of the divine monsters startling us in the temple of Salsette.3 This is no distinctive feature of British colonial rule, but only an imitation of the Dutch, and so much so that in order to characterise the working of the British East India Company, it is sufficient to literally repeat what Sir Stamford Raffles, the English Governor of Java, said of the old Dutch East India Company:\n\n \"The Dutch Company, actuated solely by the spirit of gain, and viewing their subjects with less regard or consideration than a West India planter formerly viewed a gang upon his estate, because the latter had paid the purchase money of human property, which the other had not, employed all the existing machinery of despotism to squeeze from the people their utmost mite of contribution, the last dregs of their labour, and thus aggravated the evils of a capricious and semi-barbarous Government, by working it with all the practiced ingenuity of politicians, and all the monopolising selfishness of traders.\"\n\n All the civil wars, invasions, revolutions, conquests, famines, strangely complex, rapid and destructive as the successive action in Hindostan may appear, did not go deeper than its surface. England has broken down the entire framework of Indian society, without any symptoms of reconstitution yet appearing. This loss of his old world, with no gain of a new one, imparts a particular kind of melancholy to the present misery of the Hindoo, and separates Hindostan, ruled by Britain, from all its ancient traditions, and from the whole of its past history.\n\n There have been in Asia, generally, from immemorial times, but three departments of Government: that of Finance, or the plunder of the interior; that of War, or the plunder of the exterior; and, finally, the department of Public Works. Climate and territorial conditions, especially the vast tracts of desert, extending from the Sahara, through Arabia, Persia, India and Tartary, to the most elevated Asiatic highlands, constituted artificial irrigation by canals and waterworks the basis of Oriental agriculture. As in Egypt and India, inundations are used for fertilising the soil of Mesopotamia, Persia, etc.; advantage is taken of a high level for feeding irrigative canals. This prime necessity of an economical and common use of water, Which, in the Occident, drove private enterprise to voluntary association, as in Flanders and Italy, necessitated, in the Orient where civilisation was too low and the territorial extent too vast to call into life voluntary association, the interference of the centralising power of government. Hence an economical function devolved upon all Asiatic Governments the function of providing public works. This artificial fertilisation of the soil , dependent on a Central Government, and immediately decaying with the neglect of irrigation and drainage, explains the otherwise strange fact that we now find whole territories barren and desert that were once brilliantly cultivated, as Palmyra, Petra, the ruins in Yemen, and large provinces of Egypt, Persia and Hindostan; it also explains how a single war of devastation has been able to depopulate a country for centuries, and to strip it of all its civilisation.\n\n Now, the British in East India accepted from their predecessors the department of finance and of war, but they have neglected entirely that of public works. Hence the deterioration of an agriculture which is not capable of being conducted on the British principle of free competition, of laissez-faire and laissez-aller. But in Asiatic empires we are quite accustomed to see agriculture deteriorating under one government and reviving again under some other government. There the harvests correspond to good or bad government, as they change in Europe with good or bad seasons. Thus the oppression and neglect of agriculture, bad as it is, could not be looked upon as the final blow dealt to Indian society by the British intruder, had it not been attended by a circumstance of quite different importance, a novelty in the annals of the whole Asiatic world. However changing the political aspect of India's past must appear, its social condition has remained unaltered since its remotest antiquity, until the first decennium of the 19th century. The hand-loom and the spinning-wheel, producing their regular myriads of spinners and weavers, were the pivots of the structure of that society. From immemorial times, Europe received the admirable textures of Indian labour, sending in return for them her precious metals, and furnishing thereby his material to the goldsmith, that indispensable member of Indian society, whose love of finery is so great that even the lowest class, those who go about nearly naked, have commonly a pair of golden ear-rings and a gold ornament of some kind hung round their necks. Rings on the fingers and toes have also been common. Women as well as children frequently wore massive bracelets and anklets of gold or silver, and statuettes of divinities in gold and silver were met with in the households. It was the British intruder who broke up the Indian hand-loom and destroyed the spinning wheel. England began with driving the Indian cottons from the European market; it then introduced twist into Hindostan and in the end inundated the very mother country of cotton with cottons. From 1818 to 1836 the export of twist from Great Britain to India rose in the proportion of 1 to 5,200. In 1824 the export of British muslins to India hardly amounted to 1,000,000 yards while in 1837 it surpassed 64,000,000 yards. But at the same time the population of Dacca decreased from 150,000 inhabitants to 20,000. This decline of Indian towns celebrated for their fabrics was by no means the worst consequence. British steam and science uprooted, over the whole surface of Hindostan, the union between agricultural and manufacturing industry.\n\n These two circumstances-the Hindoo, on the one hand, leaving, like all Oriental peoples, to the central government the care of the great public works, the prime condition of his agriculture and commerce, dispersed, on the other hand over the surface of the country, and agglomerated in small centres by the domestic union of agricultural and manufacturing pursuits-these two circumstances had brought about, since the remotest times, a social system of particular features-the so-called village system, which gave to each of these small unions their independent organisation and distinct life. The peculiar character of this system may be judged from the following description, contained in an old official report of the British House of Commons on Indian affairs:\n\n \"A village, geographically considered, is a tract of country comprising some hundred or thousand acres of arable and waste lands; politically viewed it resembles a corporation or township. Its proper establishment of officers and servants consists of the following descriptions: the potail, or head inhabitant, who has generally the superintendence of the affairs of the village, settles the disputes of the inhabitants, attends to the police, and performs the duty of collecting the revenue within his village, a duty which his personal influence and minute acquaintance with the situation and concerns of the people render him the best qualified for this charge. The kurnum keeps the accounts of cultivation, and registers everything connected with it. The Tallier and the totie, the duty of the former of which consists in gaining information of crimes and offences, and in escorting and protecting persons travelling from one village to another; the province of the latter appearing to be more immediately confined to the village, consisting, among other duties, in guarding the crops and assisting in measuring them. The boundary man, who preserves the limits of the village, or gives evidence respecting them in cases of dispute. The Superintendent of Tanks and Watercourses distributes the water for the purposes of agriculture. The Brahmin, who performs the village worship. The schoolmaster, who is seen teaching the children in a village to read and write in the sand. The calendar-Brahmin, or astrologer, etc. These officers and servants generally constitute the establishment of a village; but in some parts of the country it is of less extent; some of the duties and functions above described being united in the same person; in others it exceeds the above-named number of individuals. Under this simple form of municipal government, the inhabitants of the country have lived from time immemorial. The boundaries of the villages have been but seldom altered; and though the villages themselves have been sometimes injured, and even desolated by war, famine or disease, the same name, the same limits, the same interests, and even the same families, have continued for ages. The inhabitants gave themselves no trouble about the breaking up and divisions of kingdoms; while the village remains entire, they care not to what power it is transferred, or to what sovereign it devolves; its internal economy remains unchanged. The potail is still the head inhabitant, and still acts as the petty judge or magistrate, and collector or tentor of the village.\"\n\n These small stereotype forms of social organism have been to the greater part dissolved, and are disappearing, not so much through the brutal interference of the British tax-gatherer and the British soldier, as to the working of English steam and English free trade. Those family-communities were based on domestic industry, in that peculiar combination of hand-weaving, hand-spinning and hand-tilling agriculture which gave them self-supporting power. English interference having placed the spinner in Lancashire and the weaver in Bengal, or sweeping away both Hindoo spinner and weaver, dissolved these small \u2022semi-barbarian, semi-civilised communities, by blowing up their economical basis, and thus produced the greatest, and, to speak the truth, the only social revolution ever heard of in Asia.\n\n Now, sickening as it must be to human feeling to witness those myriads of industrious patriarchal and inoffensive social organizations disorganised and dissolved into their units, thrown into a sea of woes, and their individual members losing at the same time their ancient form of civilisation, and their hereditary means of subsistence, we must not forget that these idyllic village communities, inoffensive though they may appear, had always been the solid foundation of Oriental despotism, that they restrained the human mind within the smallest possible compass, making it the unresisting tool of superstition, enslaving it beneath traditional rules, depriving it of all grandeur and historical energies. We must not forget the barbarian egotism which, concentrating on some miserable patch of land, had quietly witnessed the ruin of empires, the perpetration of unspeakable cruelties, the massacre of the population of large towns, with no other consideration bestowed upon them than on natural events, itself the helpless prey of any aggressor who deigned to notice it at all. We must not forget that this undignified, stagnatory, and vegetative life, that this passive sort of existence evoked on the other part, in contradistinction, wild, aimless, unbounded forces of destruction and rendered murder itself a religious rite in Hindostan. We must not forget that these little communities were contaminated by distinctions of caste and by slavery, that they subjugated man to external circumstances instead of elevating man to be the sovereign of circumstances, that they transformed a self-developing social state into never changing natural destiny, and thus brought about a brutalising worship of nature, exhibiting its degradation in the fact that man, the sovereign of nature, fell down on his knees in adoration of Hanuman, the monkey, and Sabbala, the cow.\n\n England, it is true, in causing a social revolution in Hindostan, was actuated only by the vilest interests, and was stupid in her manner of enforcing them. But that is not the question. The question is, can mankind fulfill its destiny without a fundamental revolution in the social state of Asia? If not, whatever may have been the crimes of England she was the unconscious tool of history in bringing about that revolution.\n\n Then, whatever bitterness the spectacle of the crumbling of an ancient world may have for our personal feelings, we have the right, in point of history, to exclaim with Goethe:\n\n \"SolIte diese Qual uns qu\u00e4len,\n Da sie unsre Lust vermehrt,\n Hat nicht Myriaden Seelen\n Timur's Heerschaft aufgezehrt?\"4\n\n The Future Results of British Rule in India\n\n London, Friday, July 22, 1853\n\n How came it that English supremacy was established in India? The paramount power of the Great Mogul was broken by the Mogul Viceroys. The power of the Viceroys was broken by the Mahrattas.5 The power of the Mahrattas was broken by the Afghans, and while all were struggling against all, the Briton rushed in and was enabled to subdue them all. A country not only divided between Mohammedan and Hindoo, but between tribe and tribe, between caste and caste; a society whose framework was based on a sort of equilibrium, resulting from a general repulsion and constitutional exclusiveness between all its members. Such a country and such a society, where they not the predestined prey of conquest? If we knew nothing of the past history of Hindostan, would there not be the one great and incontestable fact, that even at this moment India is held in English thraldom by an Indian army maintained at the cost of India? India, then, could not escape the fate of being conquered, and the whole of her past history, if it be anything, is the history of the successive conquests she has undergone. Indian society has no history at all, at least no known history. What we call its historv, is but the historv of the successive intruders who founded their empires on the passive basis of that unresisting and unchanging society. The question, therefore, is not whether the English had a right to conquer India, but whether we are to prefer India conquered by the Turk, by the Persian, by the Russian, to India conquered by the Briton.\n\n England has to fulfill a double mission in India: one destructive, the other regenerating-the annihilation of old Asiatic society, and the laying of the material foundations of Western society in Asia.\n\n Arabs, Turks, Tartars, Moguls, who had successively overrun India, soon became Hindooised, the barbarian conquerors being, by an eternal law of history, conquered themselves by the superior civilization of their subjects. The British were the first conquerors superior, and therefore, inaccessible to Hindoo civilisation. They destroyed it by breaking up the native communities, by uprooting the native industry, and by levelling all that was great and elevated in the native society. The historic pages of their rule in India report hardly anything beyond that destruction. The work of regeneration hardly transpires through a heap of ruins. Nevertheless it has begun.\n\n The political unity of India, more consolidated, and extending farther than it ever did under the Great Moguls, was the first condition of its regeneration. That unity, imposed by the British sword, will now be strengthened and perpetuated by the electric telegraph. The native army, organised and trained by the British drill-sergeant, was the sine qua non of Indian self-emancipation, and of India ceasing to be the prey of the first foreign intruder. The free press, introduced for the first time into Asiatic society, and managed principally by the common offspring of Hindoo and Europeans, is a new and powerful agent of reconstruction. The Zemindarsand Ryotwar6 themselves, a bominable as they are, involve two distinct forms of private property in land-the great desideratum of Asiatic society. From the Indian natives, reluctantly and sparingly educated at Calcutta, under English superintendence, a fresh class is springing up, endowed with the requirements for government and imbued with European science. Steam has brought India into regular and rapid communication with Europe, has connected its chief ports with those of the whole south-eastern ocean, and has revindicated it from the isolated position which was the prime law of its stagnation. The day is not far distant when, by a combination of railways and steam vessels, the distance between England and India, measured by time, will be shortened to eight days, and when that once fabulous country will thus be actually annexed to the Western world.\n\n The ruling classes of Great Britain have had, till now, but an accidental, transitory and exceptional interest in the progress of India. The aristocracy wanted to conquer it, the moneyocracy to plunder it, and the millocracy to undersell it. But now the tables are turned. The millocracy have discovered that the transformation of India into a reproductive country has become of vital importance to them, and that, to that end, it is necessary, above all, to gift her with means of irrigation and of internal communication. They intend now drawing a net of railways over India. And they will do it. The results must be inappreciable.\n\n It is notorious that the productive powers of India are paralysed by the utter want of means for conveying and exchanging its various produce. Nowhere, more than in India, do we meet with social destitution in the midst of natural plenty, for want of the means of exchange. It was proved before a Committee of the British House of Commons, which sat in 1848, that \"when grain was selling from 6s. to 8s. a quarter at Kandeish, it was sold at 64s. to 70s. at Poonah, where the people were dying in the streets of famine, without the possibility of gaining supplies from Kandeish, because the clay-roads were impracticable.\"\n\n The introduction of railways may be easily made to subserve agricultural purposes by the formation of tanks, where ground is required for embankment, and by the conveyance of water along the different lines. Thus irrigation, the sine qua non of farming in the East, might be greatly extended, and the frequently recurring local famines, arising from the want of water, would be averted. The general importance of railways, viewed under this head, must become evident, when we remember that irrigated lands, even in the district near Ghauts, pay three times as much in taxes, afford ten or twelve times as much employment, and yield twelve or fifteen times as much profit, as the same area without irrigation.\n\n Railways will afford the means of diminishing the amount and the cost of the military establishments. Col. Warren, Town Major of the Fort St. William, stated before a Select Committee of the House of Commons:\n\n \"The practicability of receiving intelligence from distant parts of the country in as many hours as at present it requires days and even weeks, and of sending instructions with troops and stores, in the more brief period, are considerations which cannot be too highly estimated. Troops could be kept at more distant and healthier stations than at present, and much loss of life from sickness would by this means be spared. Stores could not to the same extent be required at the various depots, and the loss by decay, and the destruction incidental to the climate, would also be avoided. The number of troops might be diminished in direct proportion to their effectiveness.\"\n\n We know that the municipal organisation and the economical basis of the village communities has been broken up, but their worst feature, the dissolution of society into stereotyped and disconnected atoms, has survived their vitality. The village isolation produced the absence of roads in India, and the absence of roads perpetuated the village isolation. On this plan a community existed with a given scale of low conveniences, almost without intercourse with other villages, without the desires and efforts indispensable to social advance. The British having broken up this self-sufficient inertia of the villlages, railways will provide the new want of communication and intercourse. Besides, \"one of the effects of the railway system will be to bring into every village affected by it such knowledge of the contrivances and appliances of other countries, and such means of obtaining them, as will first put the hereditary and stipend diary village artisanship of India to full proof of its capabilities, and then supply its defects.\" (Chapman, The Cotton and Commerce of India.)\n\n I know that the English millocracy intend to endow India with railways with the exclusive view of extracting at diminished expenses the cotton and other raw materials for their manufactures. But when you have once introduced machinery into the locomotion of a country, which possesses iron and coals, you are unable to withhold it from its fabrication. You cannot maintain a net of railways over an immense country without introducing all those industrial processes necessary to meet the immediate and current wants of railway locomotion, and out of which there must grow the application of machinery to those branches of industry not immediately connected with railways. The railway-system will therefore become, in India, truly the forerunner of modern industry. This is the more certain as the Hindoos are allowed by British authorities themselves to possess particular aptitude for accommodating themselves to entirely new labour, and acquiring the requisite knowledge of machinery. Ample proof of this fact is afforded by the capacities and expertness of the native engineers in the Calcutta mint, where they have been for years employed in working the steam machinery, by the natives attached to the several steam engines in the Hurdwar coal districts and by other instances. Mr. Campbell himself, greatly influenced as he is by the prejudices of the East India Company, is obliged to avow \"that the great mass of the Indian people possesses a great industrial energy, is well fitted to accumulate capital, and remarkable for a mathematical clearness of head, and talent for figures and exact sciences.\" \"Their intellects,\" he says, \"are excellent.\" Modern industry, resulting from the railway-system, will dissolve the hereditary divisions of labour, upon which rest the Indian castes, those decisive impediments to Indian progress and Indian power.\n\n All the English bourgeoisie may be forced to do will neither emancipate nor materially mend the social condition of the mass of the people, depending not only on the development of the productive powers, but on their appropriation by the people. But what they will not fail to do is to lay down the material premises for both. Has the bourgeoisie ever done more? Has it ever affected a progress without dragging individuals and peoples through blood and dirt, through misery and degradation?\n\n The Indians will not reap the fruits of the new elements of society scattered among them by the British bourgeoisie, till in Great Britain itself the now ruling classes shall have been supplanted by the industrial proletariat, or till the Hindoos themselves shall have grown strong enough to throw off the English yoke altogether. At all events, we may safely expect to see, at a more or less remote period, the regeneration of that great and interesting country, whose gentle natives are, to use the expression of Prince Soltykov, even in the most inferior classes, \"plus fins et plus adroits que les Italiens,\"7 whose submission even is counterbalanced by a certain calm nobility, who, notwithstanding their natural languor, have astonished the British officers by their bravery, whose country has been the source of our languages, our religions, and who represent the type of the ancient German in the Jat and the type of the ancient Greek in the Brahmin.8\n\n I cannot part with the subject of India without some concluding remarks.\n\n The profound hypocrisy and inherent barbarism of bourgeois civilization lies unveiled before our eyes, turning from its home, where it assumes respectable forms, to the colonies, where it goes naked. They are the defenders of property, but did any revolutionary party ever originate agrarian revolutions like those in Bengal, in Madras, and in Bombay? Did they not, in India, to borrow an expression of that great robber, Lord Clive himself, resort to atrocious extortion, when simple corruption could not keep pace with their rapacity? While they prated in Europe about the inviolable sanctity of the national debt, did they not confiscate in India the dividends of the rajahs, who had invested their private savings in the Company's own funds? While they combatted the French revolution under the pretext of defending \"our holy religion,\" did they not forbid, at the same time, Christianity to be propagated in India, and did they not, in order to make money out of the pilgrims streaming to the temples of Orissa and Bengal, take up the trade in the murder and prostitution perpetrated in the temple of Juggernaut? These are the men of \"Property, Order, Family, and Religion.\"\n\n The devastating effects of English industry, when contemplated with regard to India, a country as vast as Europe, and containing 150 millions of acres, are palpable and confounding. But we must not forget that they are only the organic results of the whole system of production as -it is now constituted. That production rests on the supreme rule of capital. The centralisation of capital is essential to the existence of capital as an independent power. The destructive influence of that centralisation upon the markets of the world does but reveal, in the most gigantic dimensions, the inherent organic laws of political economy now at work in every civilised town. The bourgeois period of history has to create the material basis of the new world-on the one hand the universal intercourse founded upon the mutual dependency of mankind, and the means of that intercourse; on the other hand the development of the productive powers of man and the transformation of material production into a scientific domination of natural agencies. Bourgeois industry and commerce create these material conditions of a new world in the same way as geological revolutions have created the surface of the earth. When a great social revolution shall have mastered the results of the bourgeois epoch, the market of the world and the modern powers of production, and subjected them to the common control of the most advanced peoples, then only will human progress cease to resemble that hideous pagan idol, who would not drink the nectar but from the skulls of the slain.\n\n On Social Relations In Russia\n\n Friedrich Engels\n\nRussian radicals in the second half of the nineteenth century showed an increasingly intense interest in Marxism, and Marx noted in a letter of 1880 that in Russia \"Capital is more read and appreciated than anywhere else.\" Until the 1890's, however, the Russian socialist movement was largely Populist (narodnik), believing that in pre-bourgeois Russia there could be an early socialist revolution based on peasant rather than proletarian masses and using the archaic village commune as the nucleus of a future Russian socialist society. Leading Russian Populists occasionally wrote to Marx and Engels, either to elicit their views on the Russian situation or to defend their own views. One of them, Pyotr Tkachov, wrote an \"Open Letter\" to Engels in 1874, and Engels' reply, \"On Social Relations in Russia,\" is the fullest statement of his own and Marx's appraisal of Russian society in the late nineteenth century and the prospects for revolution there. Following the essay is a statement on the same subject from Marx's letter of March 8, 1881, to a Russian radical, Vera Zasulich.\n\n On the subject matter proper, Mr. Tkachov tells the German workers that as regards Russia I possess not even a \"little knowledge,\" possess nothing but \"ignorance\"; and he feels himself, therefore, obliged to explain to them the real state of affairs, and in particular the reasons why just at the present time a social revolution could be made in Russia with the greatest of ease, much more easily than in Western Europe.\n\n \"We have no urban proletariat, that is undoubtedly true; but, then, we also have no bourgeoisie; . . . our workers will have to fight only against the political power-the power of capital is with us still only in embryo. And you, sir, are undoubtedly aware that the fight against the former is much easier than against the latter.\"\n\n The revolution which modern socialism strives to achieve is, briefly, the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, and the establishment of a new organisation of society by the destruction of all class distinctions. This requires not only a proletariat that carries out this revolution, but also a bourgeoisie in whose hands the productive forces of society have developed so far that they allow of the final destruction of class distinctions. Among savages and semisavages there likewise often exist no class distinctions, and every people has passed through such a state. It could not occur to us to re-establish this state, for the simple reason that class distinctions necessarily emerge out of it as the productive forces of society develop. Only at a certain level of development of the productive forces of society, an even very high level for our modern conditions, does it become possible to raise production to such an extent that the abolition of class distinctions can be a real progress, can be lasting without bringing about stagnation or even decline in the mode of social production. But the productive forces have reached this level of development only in the hands of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie, therefore, in this respect also is just as necessary a precondition of the socialist revolution as the proletariat itself. Hence a man who will say that this revolution can be more easily carried out in a country, because, although it has no proletariat, it has no bourgeoisie either, only proves that he has still to learn the ABC of socialism.\n\n\n[!!] certain economic interests . . .. In our country the situation is just the reverse -the form of our society owes its existence to the state, to a state hanging in the air, so to speak, one that has nothing in common with the existing social order, and that has its roots in the past, but not in the present.\"\n\n Let us waste no time over the confused notion that the economic interests need the state, which they themselves create, in order to acquire a body, or over the bold contention that the Russian. \"form of society (which, of course, must include also the communal property of the peasants) owes its existence to the state,\" or over the contradiction that this same state \"has nothing in common\" with the existing social order which is supposed to be its very own creation. Let us rather examine at once this \"state hanging in the air,\" which does not represent the interests of even a single estate. In European Russia the peasants possess 105 million dessiatins, the nobility (as I shall here term the big landowners for .the sake of brevity) 100 million dessiatins of land, of which a bout half belong to 15,000 nobles, who consequently each possess on the average 3,300 dessiatins. The land of the peasants is therefore, only a trifle bigger than that of the nobles. So you see, the \u2022nobles have not the slightest interest in the existence of the Russian state, which protects them in the possession of half the country! To continue. The peasants, from their half, pay 195 million rubles land tax annually, the nobles-13 million! The lands of the nobles are on the average twice as fertile as those of the peasants, because during the settlement for the redemption of the corv\u00e9e the state not only took the greater part but also the best part of the land from the peasants and gave it to the nobles, and for this worst land the peasants had to pay the nobility the price of the best. And the Russian nobility has no interest in the existence of the Russian state!\n\n The peasants-taken in the mass-have been put by the redemption into a most miserable and wholly untenable position. Not only has the greatest and best part of their land been taken from them, so that in all the fertile parts of the country the peasant land is far too small-under Russian agricultural conditions-for them to be abl e to make a living from it. Not only were they charged an excessive price for it, advanced to them by the state and for which they now have to pay interest and instalments on the principal to the state. Not only is almost the whole burden of the land tax thrown upon them, whil e the nobility escapes almost scot-free-so that the land tax alone consumes the entire ground rent value of the peasant land and more, and all furth er payments which the peasant has to make and which we will spea k of immediately are diirect deductions from that part of his income which represents his wages. Then, in addition to the land tax, to the interest and amortisation payments on the money advanced by the state, since the recent introduction of local administration, there are the provincial and district imposts as well. The most essential consequence of this \"reform\" was fresh tax burdens for the peasant. The state retained its revenues in their entirety, but passed on a large part of its expenditure to the provinces and districts, which imposed new taxes to meet them, and in Russia it is the rule that the higher estates are almost tax exempt and the peasant pays almost everything.\n\n Such a situation is as if specially created for the usurer, and with the almost unequalled talent of the Russians for trading on a lower level, for taking full advantage of favourable business situations and the swindling inseparable from this-Peter I long ago said that one Russian could get the better of three Jews-the usurer everywhere makes his appearance. When taxes are about to fall due, the usurer, the kulak-frequently a rich peasant of the same village community comes along and offers his ready cash. The peasant must have the money at all costs and is obliged to accept the conditions of the usurer without demur. But this only gets him into a tighter fix, and he needs more and more ready cash. At harvest time the grain dealer arrives; the need for money forces the peasant to sell a part of the grain which he and his family require for their subsistence. The grain dealer spreads false rumours which lower prices, pays a low price and often even part of this in all sorts of high-priced goods; for the truck system is also highly developed in Russia. It is quite obvious that the great corn exports of Russia are based directly on the starvation of the peasant population. Another method of exploiting the peasant is the following: a speculator rents domain land from the government for a long term of years, and cultivates it himself as long as it yields a good crop without manure; then he divides it up into small plots and lets out the exhausted land at high rents to neighboring peasants who cannot manage on the income from their allotment. Here we have exactly the Irish middlemen, just as above the English truck system. In short, there is no country in which, in spite of the pristine savagery of bourgeois society, capitalistic parasitism is so developed, so covers and entangles the whole country, the whole mass of the population, with its nets as in Russia. And all these bloodsuckers of the peasants are supposed to have no interest in the existence of the Russian state, whose laws and law courts protect their sleek and profitable practices!\n\n The big bourgeoisie of Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, which has developed with unheard-of rapidity during the last decade, chiefly due to the railways, and which cheerfully \"went smash \" along with the rest during the last swindle years, the grain, hemp, flax and tallow exporters, whose whole business is built up on the misery of the peasant, the entire Russian large-scale industry, which only exists thanks to the protective tariffs granted it by the state-have all these important and rapidly growing elements of the population no interest in the existence of the Russian state? To say nothing of the countless army of officials, which swarms over Russia and plunders it and here constitutes a real social estate. And when Mr. Tkachov assures us that the Russian state has \"no roots in the economic life of the people,\" that \"it does not embody the interests of any particular estate,\" that it \"hangs in the air,\" methinks it is not the Russian state that hangs in the air, but rather Mr. Tkachov. It is clear that the condition of the Russian peasants since the emancipation from serfdom has become intolerable and cannot be maintained much longer, and that for this reason alone if for no other a revolution is in the offing in Russia. The question is only: what can be, what will be the result of this revolution? Mr. Tkachov says it will be a social one. This is pure tautology. Every real revolution is a social one, in that it brings a new class to power and allows it to remodel society in its own image. But he wants to say it will be a socialist one, it will introduce into Russia the form of society aimed at by West European socialism, even before we in the West succeed in doing so-and that in a condition of society in which both proletariat and bourgeoisie appear only sporadically and at a low stage of development. And this is supposed to be possible because the Russians are, so to speak, the chosen people of socialism, and have artels and common ownership of land.\n\n\n[Gewere] of the ancient Germans, the blood vengeance, etc. Moreover; in Russia the word artel is used for every form of not only collective activity but also collective institution. The Bourse is also an artel. In workers' artels, an elder (starosta, starshina) is always chosen who fulfils the functions of treasurer, bookkeeper, etc., and of manager as far as necessary and receives a special salary. Such artels are formed:\n\n 1. For temporary enterprises, after the completion of which they dissolve;\n\n 2. For the members of one and the same trade, for instance, porters, etc.;\n\n 3. For permanent enterprises, industrial in the proper sense of the word.\n\n They are established by a contract signed by all the members.\n\n[The Condition of the Working Class in Russia], St. Petersburg 1869.) Here then the artel serves to considerably facilitate the exploitation of the wage-worker by the capitalist. On the other hand, there are also artels which themselves employ wage-workers, who are not members of the association.\n\n\n[!] model, recently artificially transplanted to Russia, these have met with complete indifference on the part of the majority of our workers and have been a failure almost everywhere.\" The modern co-operative society has at least proved that it can run large-scale industry profitably on its own account (spinning and weaving in Lancashire). The artel is so far not only incapable of doing this; it must of necessity even be destroyed by big industry if it does not develop further. The communal property of the Russian peasants was discovered about the year 1845 by the Prussian Government Councillor Haxthausen and trumpeted to the world as something absolutely wonderful, although Haxthausen could still have found survivals enough of it in his Westphalian homeland, and, as a government official, it was even part of his duty to know them thoroughly. It was from Haxthausen that Herzen, himself a Russian landowner, first learned that his peasants owned the land in common, and he made use of the fact to describe the Russian peasants as the true vehicles of socialism, as born Communists in contrast to the workers of the aging, decayed European West, who would first have to go through the ordeal of acquiring socialism artificially. From Herzen this knowledge came to Bakunin, and from Bakunin to Mr. Tkachov. Let us hear the latter:\n\n\n[we shall see immediately how far the world of the Russian peasant extends] of the Russian people that today, when the government begins to understand that this idea is incompatible with the principles of a 'well-ordered' society, and in the name of these principles wishes to impress the idea of individual property on the consciousness and life of the people, it can succeed in doing so only with the help of the bayonet and the knout. It is clear from this that our people, despite its ignorance, is much nearer to socialism than the peoples of Western Europe, although the latter are more educated.\"\n\n In reality communal ownership of the land is an institution which is to be found among all Indo-Germanic peoples on a low level of development, from India to Ireland, and even among the Malays, who are developing under Indian influence, for instance, in Java. As late as 1608, in the newly conquered North of Ireland, the legally established communal ownership of the land served the English as a pretext for declaring the land as ownerless and as escheated to the Crown. In India a whole series of forms of communal property has been in existence down to the present time. In Germany it was general; the communal lands still to be found here and there are a relic of it; and often still distinct traces of it, temporary divisions of the communal lands, etc., are also to be found, especially in the mountains. More exact references and details with regard to old German communal ownership may be consulted in the various writings of Maurer, which are classic on this question. In Western Europe, including Poland and Little Russia, at a certain stage in the social development, this communal ownership became a fetter, a brake on agricultural production, and was more and more eliminated. In Great Russia (that is, Russia proper), on the other hand, it has persisted until today, thereby proving in the first place that here agricultural production and the social conditions in the countryside corresponding to it are still very undeveloped, as is actual1y the case. The Russian peasant lives and has his being only in his village community; the rest of the world exists for him only in so far as it interferes with his village community. This is so much the case that in Russia the same word, mir, means, on the one hand, \"world\" and, on the other, \"peasant community.\" Ves mir, the whole world, means to the peasant the meeting of the community members. Hence, when Mr. Tkachov speaks of the \"world outlook\" of the Russian peasants, he has obviously translated the Russian mir incorrectly. Such a complete isolation of the individual communities from one another, which creates throughout the country similar, but the very opposite of common, interests, is the natural basis for Oriental despotism, and from India to Russia this form of society, wherever it prevailed, has always produced it, and always found its complement in it. Not only the Russian state in general, but even its specific form, tsarist despotism, instead of hanging in the air, is the necessary and logical product of Russian social conditions with which, according to Mr. Tkachov, it has \"nothing in common\"! Further development of Russia in a bourgeois direction would here also destroy communal property little by little, without any need for the Russian government to intervene with \"bayonet and knout.\" And this all the more because the communally owned land in Russia is not cultivated by the peasants in common so that the product may then be divided, as is still the case in some districts in India; on the contrary, from time to time the land is divided up among the various heads of families, and each cultivates his allotment for himself. Consequently, great differences in degree of prosperity are possible among the members of the community, and actually exist. Almost everywhere there are a few rich peasants among them-here and there millionaires-who play the usurer and suck the blood of the mass of the peasants. No one knows this better than Mr. Tkachov. While he wants the German workers to believe that the \"idea of collective ownership\" can be driven out of the Russian peasants, these instinctive, traditional Communists, only by bayonet and knout, he writes on page 15 of his Russian pamphlet: \u201cAmong the peasants a class of usurers (kulaks) is making its way, a class of people who buy up and rent the lands of peasants and nobles-a muzhik aristocracy.\" These are the same kind of bloodsuckers as we described more fully above.\n\n What dealt the severest blow to communal ownership was again the redemption of the corv\u00e9e. The greater and better part of the land was allotted to the nobility; for the peasant there remained scarcely enough, often not enough, to live on. In addition the forests were given to the nobles; the wood for fuel, implements and building, which the peasant formerly might fetch there for nothing, he has now to buy. Thus the peasant has nothing now but his house and the bare land, without means to cultivate it, and on the average without enough land to support him and his family from one harvest to the next. Under such conditions and under the pressure of taxes and usurers, communal ownership of the land is no longer a blessing; it becomes a fetter. The peasants often run away from it, with or without their families, to earn their living as migratory labourers, and leave their land behind them.2\n\n It is clear that communal ownership in Russia is long past its period of florescence and to all appearances is moving towards its disintegration. Nevertheless, the possibility undeniably exists of raising this form of society to a higher one, if it should last until circumstances are ripe for that, and if it shows itself capable of development in such manner that the peasants no longer cultivate the land separately, but collectively;3 of raising it to this higher form without it being necessary for the Russian peasants to go through the intermediate stage of bourgeois small holdings. This, however, can only happen if, before the complete break-up of communal ownership, a proletarian revolution is successfully carried out in Western Europe, creating for the Russian peasant the preconditions requisite for such a transition, particularly the material conditions which he needs if only to carry through the revolution necessarily connected therewith of his whole agricultural system. It is, therefore, sheer bounce for Mr. Tkachov to say that the Russian peasants, although \"owners,\" are \"nearer to socialism\" than the propertyless workers of \"Western Europe. Quite the opposite. If anything can still save Russian communal ownership and give it a chance of growing into a new, really viable form, it is a proletarian revolution in Western Europe.\n\n Mr. Tkachov treats the political revolution just as lightly as he does the economic one. The Russian people, he relates, \"protests incessantly\" against its enslavement, now in form of \"religious sects. . . refusal to pay taxes .. . robber bands (the German workers will be glad to know that, accordingly, Schinderhannes4 is the father of German Social-Democracy) . .. incendiarism .. . revolts . . . and hence the Russian people may be termed an instinctive revolutionist.\" And thus Mr. Tkachov is convinced that \"it is only necessary to evoke an outburst in a number of places at the same time of all the accumulated bitterness and discontent, which is always seething in the breast of our people.\" Then \"the union of the revolutionary forces will come about of itself, and the fight ... must end favourably for the people's cause. Practical necessity, the instinct of self-preservation,\" will then achieve quite of itself \"a firm and indissoluble alliance among the protesting village communities.\"\n\n It is impossible to conceive of a revolution on easier and more pleasant terms. One starts shooting, at three or four places simultaneously, and the \"instinctive revolutionist,\" \"practical necessity\" and the \"instinct of self-preservation\" do the rest \"of themselves.\" Being so dead easy, it is simply incomprehensible why the revolution has not long ago been made, the people liberated and Russia transformed into the model socialist country.\n\n Actually, it is quite a different matter. The Russian people, this instinctive revolutionist, has, true enough, made numerous isolated peasant revolts against the nobility and against individual officials, but never against the tsar, except when a false tsar put himself at its head and claimed the throne. The last great peasant rising, under Catherine II, was only possible because Yemelyan Pugachov claimed to be her husband, Peter III, who allegedly had not been murdered by his wife, but dethroned and clapped in prison, and who had now escaped. The tsar is, on the contrary, the earth god of the Russian peasant: Bog vysoko, tsar daleko-God is on high and the tsar far away, is his cry in the hour of need. There is no doubt that the mass of the peasant population, especially since the redemption of the corv\u00e9e, has been reduced to a condition which more and more forces on it a fight also against the government and the tsar; but Mr. Tkachov will have to try to sell his fairy-tale of the \"instinctive revolutionist\" somewhere else.\n\n And then, even if the mass of the Russian peasants were ever so instinctively revolutionary, even if we imagined that revolutions could be made to order, just as one makes a piece of flowered calico or a teakettle-even then I ask, is it permissible for one over twelve years of age to imagine the course of a revolution in such an utterly childish manner as is the case here? And remember further that this was written after the first revolution made on this Bakunin model-the Spanish one of 1873-had so brilliantly failed. There, too, they let loose at several places simultaneously. There too it was calculated that practical necessity and the instinct of self-preservation would of themselves bring about a firm and indissoluble alliance between the protesting communities. And what happened? Every village community, every town only defended itself, there was no question of mutual assistance, and with only three thousand men Pavia overcame one town after another in a fortnight and put an end to the entire anarchist glory. (Cf. my Bakuninists at Work, where this is described in detail.)\n\n Russia undoubtedly is on the eve of a revolution. Her financial affairs are in extreme disorder. Taxes cannot be screwed any higher, the interest on old state loans is paid by means of new loans, and every new loan meets with greater difficulties; money can now only be raised under the pretext of building railways! The administration, as of old, corrupt from top to bottom, the officials living more from theft, bribery and extortion than on their salaries. The entire agricultural production-by far the most essential for Russia-completely dislocated by the redemption settlement of 1861; the big landowners without sufficient labour power, the peasants without sufficient land, oppressed by taxation and sucked dry by usurers, agricultural production declining from year to year. The whole held together with great difficulty and only outwardly by an Oriental despotism whose arbitrariness we in the West simply cannot imagine; a despotism which not only from day to day comes into more glaring contradiction with the views of the enlightened classes and in particular with those of the rapidly developing bourgeoisie of the capital, but which, in the person of its present bearer, has lost its head, one day making concessions to liberalism and the next, frightened, cancelling them again and thus bringing itself more and more into disrepute. With all that a growing recognition among the enlightened strata of the nation concentrated in the capital that this position is untenable: that a revolution is impending, and the illusion that it will be possible to guide this revolution into a smooth, constitutional channel. Here all the conditions of a revolution are combined, of a revolution which, started by the upper classes of the capital, perhaps even by the government itself, must be rapidly carried further, beyond the first constitutional phase, by the peasants; of a revolution which will be of the greatest importance for the whole of Europe if only because it will destroy at one blow the last, so far intact, reserve of the entire European reaction. This revolution is surely approaching. Only two events could still delay it; a successful war against Turkey or Austria, for which money and firm alliances are necessary, or-a premature attempt at insurrection, which would drive the possessing classes back into the arms of the government.\n\n Marx's Reply to Vera Zasulich\n\n * * * the analysis given in Capital assigns no reasons for or against the vitality of the rural community, but the special research into this subject which I conducted, the materials for which I obtained from original sources, has convinced me that this community is the mainspring of Russia's social regeneration, but in order that it might function as such one would first have to eliminate the deleterious influences which assail it from every quarter and then to ensure the conditions normal for spontaneous development.\n\n Europocentric World Revolution\n\nThe proletarian socialist revolution was to be a world revolution (a world market having taken shape under capitalism), and, as Marx said in The Class Struggles in France, \"the social revolution of the nineteenth century.\" Europe's advanced capitalism made it appear the natural epicenter of world revolution. How would European revolution be affected by and affect developments elsewhere? A letter of October 8, 1858, to Engels reflected Marx's uneasiness on this score. A much later letter, from Engels to Karl Kautsky on September 12, 1882, voiced a more sanguine view in the suggestion that a socialist Europe and North America would lead the rest of the world to socialist revolution by force of example.\n\n Marx to Engels\n\n * * * The specific task of bourgeois society is the establishment of a world market, at least in outline, and of production based upon this world market. As the world is round, this seems to have been completed by the colonisation of California and Australia and the opening up of China and Japan. The difficult question for us is: on the Continent the revolution is imminent and will immediately assume a socialist character. Is it not bound to be crushed in this little corner, considering that in a far greater territory the movement of bourgeois society is still in the ascendant?\n\n Engels to Karl Kautsky\n\n * * * You ask me what the English workers think about colonial policy. Well, exactly the same as they think about politics in general: the same as the bourgeois think. There is no workers ' party here, you see, there are only Conservatives and Liberal-Radicals, and the workers gaily share the feast of England's monopoly of the world market and the colonies. In my opinion the colonies proper, i.e., the countries occupied by a European population-Canada, the Cape, Australia-will all become independent; on the other hand, the countries inhabited by a native population, which are simply subjugated-India, Algeria, the Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish possessions-must be taken over for the time being by the proletariat and led as rapidly as possible towards independence. How this process will develop is difficult to say. India will perhaps, indeed very probably, make a revolution, and as a proletariat in process of self-emancipation cannot conduct any colonial wars, it would have to be allowed to run its course; it would not pass off without all sorts of destruction, of course, but that sort of thing is inseparable from all revolutions. The same might also take place elsewhere, e.g., in Algeria and Egypt, and would certainly be the best thing for us. We shall have enough to do at home. Once Europe is reorganized, and North America, that will furnish such colossal power and such an example that the semi-civilized countries will of themselves follow in their wake; economic needs, if anything, will see to that. But as to what social and political phases these countries will then have to pass through before they likewise arrive at socialist organization, I think we today can advance only rather idle hypotheses. One thing alone is certain: the victorious proletariat can force no blessings of any kind upon any foreign nation without undermining its own victory by so doing. Which of course by no means excludes defensive wars of various kinds. * * *\n\n Notes\n1.

Here is Rhodes, leap here!\" That is, \"Show us right here what you can do.\" The German paraphrase of the Greek quotation (Rhodus means rose) was used by Hegel in the preface to his Philosophy of Right.\n\n6.

Montalembert, the head of the miIitant Catholic Party, spoke, during the discussions on the repeal of universal suffrage, on the necessity of undertaking a Roman expedition \"within\"\nFrance-meaning support of the Roman Pope and the Catholic clergy. Marx, on the other hand, is speaking of an expedition against Rome in the sense of a struggle against the clergy.\n\n4. Bailiffs.\n\n5. Meaning an agreement by which one gets the lion's share.\n\n6.

(he picks up a container of fruit)\n\nJERRY: Restaurants too?\n\nGEORGE: Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on pasta.

Never the less, the expense account is for business purposes only.\n\nELAINE: Well, well isn't the president allowed to do anything that they want?\n\nROGER: No. I'll be in your office first thing tomorrow.

You know the way I work. I'm like a commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear it a few times, you\u2019re hummin\u2019 it in the shower, by the third date it's (sings) \"By Mennen!\".\n\nJERRY: How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?\n\nGEORGE: If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf -- I go back to her place to pick it up...(pop sound) date number two.\n\nJERRY: That is so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood horse?\n\nJERRY IS AT HIS APARTMENT DOOR\n\nJERRY: (sings theme) \"By Mennen.\" What the?...\n\nJerry notices a red dot on his door, Using his hand, he traces the red light coming from Kramer's peep hole. Jerry knocks on Kramer's door. Kramer opens the door -- a huge red light is flooding the apartment as well as a pronounced buzzing sound. Kramer is smoking away on a cigar. Jerry is taken-a-back by the bright red light.\n\nJERRY: What's going on in there?\n\nKRAMER: What?\n\nJERRY: That light!\n\nKRAMER: Oh the red. Yeah, It\u2019s the chicken roaster sign. You know, its right across from my window.\n\nJERRY: Can't you shut the shades?\n\nKRAMER: They are shut. Oh by the way, your friend Seth, he stopped by.\n\nJERRY: Oh yeah? What'd he have to say?\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, he was fired.\n\nELAINE'S OFFICE, ELAINE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THE ACCOUNTING GUY THAT ALL OF HER EXPENSES ARE BUSINESS RELATED\n\nELAINE: Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually the Aristotle goose down tunic. (laughs, modeling the comforter) What do you think?\n\nROGER: (sarcastically) Another bulls eye.\n\nELAINE: Hmm. Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses was obviously for a legitimate business purpose.\n\nElaine turns on Waterpik to water the plants.\n\nROGER: I just need to see the sable hat you purchased yesterday.\n\nELAINE: The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?\n\nROGER: It costs eight-thousand dollars.\n\nELAINE: What?\n\nElaine, surprised at the cost of the hat, turns and accidentally hits Roger with water from Waterpik -- he tries to block the water stream from hitting him.\n\nELAINE: Ohh. (trying to control the Waterpik and shut it off.)\n\nJERRY IS TALKING TO SETH AT HIS APARTMENT\n\nJERRY: Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you go the lunch with me?\n\nSETH: We're old college buddies.\n\nJERRY: I only knew you through Moochie.\n\nSETH: Hey Jerry don't worry about it all right. The important thing is, is we got to catch up. Mind if I ah, grab the want ads?\n\nJERRY: Um, actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet. (takes the paper back)\n\nExit Seth. Kramer comes over, walks into the doorjam. Red light still blaring\n\nJERRY: How's life on the red planet? (shuts door)\n\nKRAMER: Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep. All I can see is that giant red sun in the shape of a chicken. (gets some cereal from the cubard and pours it in a big bowl)\n\nJERRY: Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?\n\nKRAMER: Ah, they gave me the heave ho. You know, I don't think that Kenny Rogers has any idea what's going on down there.\n\nKramer takes a pitcher of red liquid from the fridge and pours it on his cereal.\n\nJERRY: What are you doing?\n\nKRAMER: Getting some cereal\n\nJERRY: That, that's tomato juice.\n\nKramer takes a big spoonful of cereal with tomato juice!\nSpits out cereal\n\nKRAMER: That looked like milk to me! Jerry my rods and cones are all screwed up! Alright, that's it. I gotta move in with you Jerry.\n\nKramer takes the bowl to the trash can and proceeds to spill the cereal and tomato juice all over Jerry's wall in the area around the trash can\n\nJERRY: I don't know Kramer, ahh, my concern is that ....\n\nKramer attempts to cleans the mess with a dish rag....\n\nJERRY: ..living together after a while we... we might start to get on each others nerves a little.\n\nSqueezes juice from rag into pitcher and puts it back in the fridge\n\nKRAMER: Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. Now, you're a heavy sleeper, right? Why don't we just switch apartments?\n\nJERRY: Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls down, make it an eight room luxury suite.\n\nKRAMER: (taking Jerry's suggestion seriously) Jerry these are load bearing walls, they're not gonna come down!\n\nJERRY: Yeah, that's no good.\n\nKRAMER: I may have to drive that place out of business.\n\nJERRY: How you gonna do that?\n\nKRAMER: Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.\n\nKramer makes a peace sign and a pop noise.\nKramer opens door and leans way back from the overwhelming red neon light\nGEORGE IS DROPPING OFF THE SALES WOMAN THAT SOLD HIM THE HAT.\n\nHEATHER: Thanks George, but I got it from here.\n\nGEORGE: Oh no I'm in already come on.\n\nGeorge puts down the bags he came in with\n\nGEORGE: So eh, you eh, wanna get together tomorrow?\n\nHEATHER: No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.\n\nGEORGE: What about this weekend?\n\nHEATHER: I'm gonna be busy for a while.\n\nGEORGE: OK, ah..

GEORGE IS LOOKING AT A BUNCH OF FAKE BUTTERFLIES ON THE WALL\n\nELAINE: What do you mean you don't have the hat?\n\nGEORGE: I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?

What do you think?\n\nJERRY: I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place, but that couldn't be.\n\nSETH: Yeah, I'm the new manager\n\nJERRY: But your were an executive, this is fast food.\n\nSETH: Not fast food, good food quickly. Hey, next time lunch\u2019ll be on me, huh Jer.\n\nKramer opens his window revealing a banner saying \"BAD CHICKEN\"\n\nKRAMER: Hey, stay away from the chicken. Bad, bad chicken, mess you up.\n\nSETH: That's not going to be good for business.\n\nJERRY: That's not going to be good for anybody.\n\nKRAMER AND JERRY ARE TALKING IN JERRY'S APARTMENT.\n\nKRAMER: Jerry I\u2019m so glad we switched apartments. It was a perfect solution.\n\nJERRY: Look Kramer, i-i-if I'm gonna live over there, y-y-you gotta take some of this stuff out. I mean this thing is really freaking me out (holds up a ventriloquist dummy). I feel like its gonna come to life in the middle of the night and kill me.\n\nKRAMER: What, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.\n\nJERRY: And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...\n\nJerry is interrupted by the sound of a toilet flush, out comes Newman from the bathroom who then tosses a newspaper on the table\n\nJERRY: Oh no.\n\nNEWMAN: Nice place you got here Kramer ...\n\nKRAMER: Yeah.\n\nNEWMAN: ... a man can really get some thinking done. (sits on couch, next to Kramer.)\n\nJERRY: Well don't get too comfortable. As soon as Seth gets a real job you two are gong back in that chicken supernova.\n\nJerry puts on giant sunglasses and goes to Kramer's apartment. Newman starts eating chicken\n\nKRAMER: What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.\n\nNEWMAN: I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.\n\nKRAMER: Well I'm boycotting it.\n\nNEWMAN: (eating) hm.\n\nKramer looks at the chicken.\n\nKRAMER: What is that, hickory?\n\nNEWMAN: Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.\n\nKRAMER: Really?\n\nNEWMAN: Uh-Huh.\n\nKramer reaches for some and Newman growls,\n\nKRAMER: Oh stop it. (he slaps Newman\u2019s shoulder) What\u2019s the matter with you.\n\nKramer takes a piece of chicken and looks like he loves it\n\nKRAMER: Mmmmm.\n\nEXTERIOR DUSK SHOT OF HEATHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING. KNOCK ON HEATHER'S DOOR.\n\nHEATHER: Can I help you?\n\nElaine stands in the doorway, off to the side\n\nELAINE: Hi, yeah, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's...\n\nHEATHER: Oh.\n\nELAINE: ... I'm a friend of George Costanza's. (while she is talking, she is dragging George in by pulling his ear)\n\nGEORGE: Hi.\n\nELAINE: Ah, (releases George\u2019s ear) whether you're aware of it or not George had this pathetic little plan to, leave something behind so he could weasel a second date.\n\nHEATHER: Really?\n\nELAINE: I know, he- he has a real confidence problem.\n\nGEORGE: Well not really...\n\nELAINE: George...\n\nGEORGE: Ah... (quietly)\n\nELAINE: ... Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the hat because you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could not be. But, I really do need to have the hat back.\n\nHEATHER: Look, I don't know what to tell you, but there's no hat here. I mean, maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...\n\nGEORGE: Well that makes sense.\n\nGeorge starts to leave, so Elaine grabs him by the ear and pulls him back in\n\nELAINE: Well then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?\n\nHEATHER: Be my guest.\n\nElaine drags George in by his ear\n\nGEORGE: Good to see you again.\n\nGeorge and Elaine exit the apartment looking tired. The door shuts hard.\n\nGEORGE: She's bluffing...\n\nELAINE: Uhhh...\n\nGEORGE: ... She's got it stashed away in there somewhere.\n\nELAINE: This is an absolute disaster.\n\nGEORGE: Oh I don't know. Check this out.\n\nGeorge holds up a golden clock he had hidden in his jacket.\n\nELAINE: You stole her clock?\n\nGeorge smiles\n\nELAINE: Well done. (pats George on the shoulder)\n\nGEORGE: Yep, this is one for our side!\n\nCUT TO JERRY'S APARTMENT, KRAMER IS IN JERRY'S BED EATING KENNY ROGER'S CHICKEN. KRAMER WIPES HIS FACE ON JERRY'S SHEETS, AND DOING SO FOUND ANOTHER PIECE OF CHICKEN, KRAMER THROWS IT ON THE FLOOR.\nCUT TO KRAMER'S APARTMENT, JERRY IS WIDE AWAKE IN THE DARK (RED).\n\nJERRY: (Thinking) What is that creaking, its like I'm in the hold of a ship. Gotta relax.\n\nCreaking sound, then the sound of a door opening\n\nJERRY: (startled - eyes wide open) Hello, is somebody there? (scurrying sound) Mr.- Mr. Marbles?\n\nMORNING AT JERRY APARTMENT\n\nELAINE: So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon. What am I gonna do?\n\nKRAMER: You should sleep with him.\n\nEnter Jerry, his hair is like Kramer's. Jerry enters doing Kramer's slide. The red light floods the hallway from Kramer\u2019s apartment\n\nJERRY: Hey buddy. I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know what it's like in there, all night long things are creaking and cracking. And that red light is burning my brain!\n\nrubs his eyes with the palms of his hands - fingers outstretched\n\nELAINE: You look a little stressed.\n\nJERRY: Oh I'm stressed! (makes like Kramer, outstretching his arm. Jerry heads for the freezer for some ice cream.)\n\nELAINE: So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that fur hat by four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.\n\nJERRY: You know my friend Bob Sacamano?\n\nELAINE: I thought he was Kramer's friend.\n\nJERRY: Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. and we got to talking, he sells Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.\n\nELAINE: Forty bucks? Are they Sable?\n\nJERRY: No, but the difference is negligible.\n\nKRAMER: Oh yea, I like this idea. (sounding very much like Jerry)\n\nELAINE: Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.\n\nJERRY: Giddee up!\n\nExit Elaine and Jerry. Newman reveals himself, he was hiding in the bathroom.\n\nNEWMAN: It's getting cold, it's getting cold.\n\nKRAMER: That was a close one.\n\nNEWMAN: Well why do we have to keep this from Jerry?\n\nKRAMER: Because if Jerry finds out that I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back there with the red menace.\n\nNewman and Kramer start open the grocery bag.\nBACK TO ELAINE'S OFFICE\n\nIPSWITCH: Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, this is Nutria.\n\nELAINE: w-w- Well, that's a -ah, it\u2019s kind of Sable.\n\nIPSWITCH: No, its a kind of rat.\n\nELAINE: That's a rat hat?\n\nIPSWITCH: And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have no choice but to recommend your prompt termination to the board of directors. Nothing short of the approval of Peterman himself will save you this time.\n\nELAINE: But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.\n\nIPSWITCH: And quite mad too from what I hear.\n\nELAINE: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Can I fire you?\n\nIPSWITCH: No.\n\nMONK'S DINER -- GEORGE AND KRAMER ARE EATING TOGETHER\n\nKRAMER: So Heather called?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have the time'. Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?\n\nKRAMER: No, but this is all very exciting. (sounding very much like jerry)\n\nGEORGE: She knows that I have her clock. I know that she has my hat. I think she's getting ready to make an exchange.\n\nKRAMER: Well there is the possibility that you've gone right out of your mind.\n\nGEORGE: I've looked at that, seems unlikely.\n\nKRAMER: I'd look again. So ah, how come you didn't call Jerry about all this?\n\nGEORGE: Jerry, I can't talk to Jerry anymore. Ever since he moved into that apartment he's too much ... like you.\n\nKRAMER: Hmm. That's a shame.\n\nJERRY TALKING TO SETH INSIDE KENNY ROGERS ROASTERS\n\nJERRY: Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off that sign?\n\nSETH: Jerry I lied. I'm just an assistant manager.\n\nSETH: (On loud speaker) Number sixty seven, family feast.\n\nNEWMAN: Number 67, right here, right here!\n\nJERRY: Hello Newman.\n\nNEWMAN: Hello Jerry.\n\nSETH: And don't forget your steamed broccoli.\n\nJERRY: Hold it. Broccoli? Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep fried in chocolate sauce.\n\nNEWMAN: I love.. broccoli, it\u2019s, good for you.\n\nJERRY: Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?\n\nJerry opens container. Newman takes a piece\n\nNEWMAN: Gladly. (starts munching on the broccoli, then spits it out)\n\nNEWMAN: Vile weed!\n\nJERRY: It's Kramer isn't it? I knew it! The greasy door knob the constant licking of the fingers, he's hooked to the chicken isn't he?\n\nNEWMAN: Yes, Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.\n\nNewman drinks mustard like a shot of Henningin's whiskey. He slaps his hand on the counter 7 times, adjusts his coat, coughs and exits\nJERRY'S APARTMENT, KRAMER, TAPPING HIS FORK ON THE TABLE WITH AN EMPTY PLATE IN FRONT OF HIM. HE IS WAITING FOR NEWMAN. JERRY COMES IN. RED LIGHT FLOODS THE HALLWAY\n\nKRAMER: Newman, what took you... ah hey, hey\n\nsurprised to see Jerry, Kramer removes the napkin from his shirt front and wipes his mouth like he just finished a meal.\n\nJERRY: Expecting Newman? That's funny because I just happened upon him down at the Kenny Roger's Roasters.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, shh, Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.\n\nJERRY: He was buying quite a load of chicken, almost for two people ...\n\nKRAMER: Oh\n\nJERRY: ... as long as one of them is not him.\n\nKRAMER: (laughs) Oh hey, you know Elaine, ah she stopped by...\n\nJERRY: Uh-ha.\n\nKRAMER: ... Yeah dropped off that Bob Sacamano hat. Oh she's ah, upset at him, oh yes siree. Yeah well thanks for stopping by.\n\nJERRY: I sure do miss my apartment. Maybe I'll switch back.\n\nKRAMER: Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise I'd have no choice but to put that banner back up and eh, he-he-hwow, run that Roger's right out of town.\n\nJERRY: I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you the trouble. I'll do it myself.\n\nKRAMER: Yeah, yeah go ahead yeah, put the banner up doesn't matter to me.\n\nJERRY: All right. (opens door - Red light floods hallway - a buzzing sound emanates.)\n\nKRAMER: No Jerry! I - I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken. Now you leave those roasters alone. Kenny never hurt anybody.\n\nJERRY: You got a little problem.\n\nKRAMER: Oh I got a big problem Jerry!\n\nSHOT OF A MAP - MYANMAR, BURMA. ELAINE IS VISITING PETERMAN IN THE BURMESE JUNGLE.

THIS SCENE IS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE MOVIE APOCALYPSE NOW\n\nBOY: Here, kneel here.\n\nELAINE: What?\n\nBOY: Kneel.\n\nELAINE: Kneel?\n\nThe sound of water dripping, as Peterman squeezes a cloth onto the back of his neck, ala Colonel Kurtz in the movie Apocalypse Now\n\nPETERMAN: Elaine.\n\nELAINE: Mr. Peterman.\n\nA boy cuts a pineapple with a large knife in the background. Elaine is startled and turns to look at him. Peterman scolds him in another language\n\nPETERMAN: Jaba! Bagama ma Jaba. Olymala Hungui. (The boy runs out of the room)\n\nELAINE: You speak Burmese?\n\nPETERMAN: No Elaine, that was gibberish.\n\nELAINE: Ah.\n\nPETERMAN: So did you have any trouble finding the place?\n\nELAINE: No, you're the only, white poet warlord in the neighborhood. (laughs)\n\nPETERMAN: Are you an assassin?\n\nELAINE: I - I work for your mail order catalog.\n\nPETERMAN: You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect a bill.\n\nELAINE: Well actually um, I do have a bill here.

The first time we went out, I found you very irritating. But after seeing you a couple of times, you sorta got stuck in my head, (sings) Ca-stan-za!

ALBUQUERQUE POLICE STATION\nThe camera slowly pans down past a wanted board, until Jimmy comes into view. He turns to Mike, who is sitting beside him.\n\nJIMMY: Once again... I do all the talking. That's the only way this works.\n\nWe start to hear footsteps approaching in the distance. Two detectives come around the corner.\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: Hand it over.\n\nJIMMY: Now, before that happens...\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: Hand it over.\n\nJIMMY: No. Hey. I've got it right here.\n\nJimmy reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a notepad.\n\nJIMMY: Is this it?\n\nDetective Abbasi quickly snatches the notepad from jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: I'll I will take that as a yes. Very well. Mystery solved.\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: You know, I could take you into custody right now, you son of a bitch. Both of you.\nJIMMY: Whoa, whoa. Where's this coming from?\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: You're the one who spilled the coffee, you ambulance-chasing piece of shit!\n\nJIMMY: Can we dial it down, you know, just a notch? Look, 45 minutes ago, I'm sound asleep. I get a call from Mr. Ehrmantraut. He's concerned. He's getting threatening voicemails from you accusing him of petty theft. I tell him, \"hey, we're gonna nip this in the bud. I don't care what the hell time it is. We're gonna go talk this thing out.\" And walking across the parking lot, just now boom there's a notepad, plain as day, lying on the asphalt, where I can only surmise you accidentally dropped it, Detective. Now, guys, that's that's all we know.\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: Let me tell you something, Slick... wait till I get you back to Philadelphia.\n\nJIMMY: I'm confused. The state of Pennsylvania can extradite people for returning lost property? Wow, that is one bold legislature.\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: Anything you want to say to me about what you found in here? Hmm? Now that it's all out in the open? Maybe your daughter-in-law maybe she's got something to tell me.\n\nMIKE: Maybe. Maybe not.\n\nDETECTIVE ABBASI: Yeah, we'll see. First thing tomorrow I mean, you got to figure she wouldn't reach out to us if she had nothing to say. Hopefully, whatever you are didn't rub off on the rest of your family.\n\nDetective Abbasi walks away out of sight\n\nMIKE: Thanks.\n\nJIMMY: You're welcome. Let's get the hell out of here.\n\nMIKE: No, I mean thanks, as in three's a crowd. You can go now.\n\nJIMMY: You're not talking to my client without me.\nMIKE: Yeah, he is. Please leave now.\n\nJimmy walks away. Detective Sanders takes a seat beside Mike\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: You ever have jet lag? I guess that's what this is. Maybe it's the altitude, huh?\n\nMIKE: Could be the altitude.\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: We're a mile up, right? Sorry about the kid. He's young, looking to make his mark.\n\nMIKE: I like him.\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: Your daughter-in-law what what's she gonna tell us?\n\nMIKE: I don't honestly know.\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say, this pretty well ends it here. So maybe you should talk to her before we do.\n\nMIKE: I talked. If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much. But either way, that's up to her. That's the least I owe her.\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: There's a lot of people we both know that think that Fensky got what was coming to him Hoffman, too. That whole precinct was a sewer. Wouldn't be surprised if there's a few more early retirements. Might be a good thing new blood.\n\nMIKE: Like the kid.\n\nDETECTIVE SANDERS: Yeah. He's all right. He's just got to learn, that's all. Some rocks you don't turn over.\nDetective Sanders begins to get up to his feet. He looks at Mike and then walks away\nEXT. PARKING LOT\nJimmy stands up against his car, waiting for Mike. We can hear footsteps approaching.\n\nJIMMY: What did you say to him? Let's go, word for word, verbatim, while it's still fresh.\n\nMIKE: What I said is none of your concern. I was speaking to a friend.\n\nJIMMY: (Chuckles) You were speaking to a homicide detective who flew 2,000 miles to investigate a double murder for which you are clearly the prime suspect. How could you not recognize the mind games, the scams, the the con jobs these people play? You used to be one of them. So what got said? Right now, come on. I'm serious.\n\nMIKE: I know you're trying to help me, but you can't go...\n\nJIMMY: Look, no, I'm trying to help me. Those two Philly cheesesteaks they want to lock me up right alongside you. So, work with me here, for the both of us.\n\nMIKE: You're safe, Counselor, and I no longer require your services.\n\nJIMMY: You're... you're kidding, right? What you think you're gonna defend yourself?\n\nMIKE: It's in someone else's hands.\n\nJIMMY: What like God?\n\nMIKE: No.\n\nJIMMY: Please don't say Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill.\n\nMIKE: I appreciate your help. Go home. Go to bed. Send me your bill.\n\nJIMMY: Oh, I'm sending you my bill.\n\nMike climbs into his car, starts the engine, and drives out of the parking lot.\n\nJIMMY: I'm sending... You better believe it!\n\nEXT. CHUCK'S HOUSE\nJimmy's car pulls up outside Chucks house.\nINT. CHUCK'S HOUSE\n\nJIMMY: It's me your friendly neighborhood ice man. There was a run on bacon. I'll get you next time. Chuck, you there?\n\nJimmy walks through the living room and towards the staircase looking for Chuck.\n\nJIMMY: Chuck? Chuck? Chuck, you up there? Hello?\n\nCHUCK (O.S): I'm out here!\n\nJimmy heads towards the backdoor, where he finds Chuck standing outside.\nEXT. CHUCK'S HOUSE\n\nCHUCK: 112, 113, 114...\n\nJIMMY: Holy shit! What are you doing?\n\nCHUCK: Shh! 115, 116, 117, 18, 119... 120. Go! Go! Inside!\n\nJimmy and Chuck go back inside, closing the door behind them.\nINT. CHUCK'S HOUSE\n\nJIMMY: What the hell was that? What the hell was that?\n\nCHUCK: Just give me a second.\n\nChuck sits down on the couch, catching his breath.\n\nCHUCK: Ohh. Okay. Okay. It's an experiment, really. I've been attempting to build up a tolerance for electromagnetic fields.\n\nJIMMY: Seriously?\n\nCHUCK: Yeah. Yeah, it's like, um, you know, like taking small doses of poison to build up an immunity.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, well, is that a real thing? 'Cause that does not sound like a real thing.\n\nCHUCK: It's a real thing. Anyway, as you well know, there is a 60-kilovolt transformer 200 meters south-southwest of my front yard. And I've been trying to get acclimated to it. I got up to two minutes today.\n\nJIMMY: Jesus, Chuck.\n\nCHUCK: Yeah. Two days ago, I could barely stand 30 seconds. I'm trying to get up to five minutes by next week.\n\nJIMMY: That is just... uh, but why now?\n\nCHUCK: Well, after what happened with the police and the hospital, I almost lost everything, Jimmy. I can't go on like this. I have to find a way to get better. I've got to. I have to get back to work. Sitting here, rotting away this is no kind of life for me for anyone. I need to be useful again.\n\nJIMMY: Chuck I am so proud of you.\n\nCHUCK: Oh. It'll be a long process, but one to which I'm very much committed. I have to be.\n\nJIMMY: God, I I'll be right back. I got to get a few more things out of the car.\n\nCHUCK: All right.\n\nJimmy heads out of the front door. Chuck stays on the couch, stretching and laughing.\nINT. CHUCK'S HOUSE - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM\nJimmy wheels a cart with few boxes on through the door and into the living room\n\nCHUCK: What's all this?\n\nJIMMY: It's just some case files. I'm out of room at the office. I don't want to leave them in the car. There's a lot of sensitive information.\n\nCHUCK: Y... you're not planning to leave them here. Yeah, I don't know, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: It'll just be for a little while, okay? I'm practically sleeping on these things back at my place.\n\nCHUCK: Business is that good?\n\nJIMMY: It's booming streets of gold. Yeah. I'll get these out of here as quick as I can. I just need to file the 4-13s on some of these wills, and, uh, I'll be out of your hair.\n\nCHUCK: 4-13s?\n\nJIMMY: Personal property statements.\n\nCHUCK: You mean 5-13s.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah. Sorry. I was just working with these seniors. Maybe the dementia's contagious, huh?\n\nJimmy pats Chuck's shoulder, and starts walking towards the door. Leaving Chuck with the case files.\n\nJIMMY: So, uh, we good here? See you tomorrow. Same time.\n\nChuck takes a good look at the boxes, his hands twitching. He takes a deep breath, and grabs one of the files from the box. Jimmy watches from a window nearby.\nINT. OFFICE BUILDING\nJimmy and Kim walk through the door of the building into the lobby area.\n\nJimmy: James McGill. Scott said he'd leave the keys to 801, the suite that's for lease.\n\nThe guard hands Jimmy the keys to the suite.\n\nLOBBY GUARD: Here you go. Just bring them back when you're done.\n\nJIMMY: You got it.\n\nKIM: Wow, this is, like really nice.\n\nJIMMY: Why do you sound surprised?\n\nKIM: Not surprised, no. Just, you know, could you afford this?\n\nJIMMY: Oh, yeah. Are you kidding? Those seniors have been very good to me. I've been meaning to expand, you know? It's time to invest in myself. Figure this may be just the place.\n\nKIM: Well, won't you miss the nail salon?\n\nJIMMY: Oh, I can always visit, you know, get some French tips.\n\nJimmy and Kim take the elevator up to the suite.\nINT. OFFICE SUITE\n\nKIM: Wow.\n\nJIMMY: It's a clean slate. Put the, uh, reception desk right here. Uh, get some comfortable seating for the clients.\n\nKIM: It's big lot of offices.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, I like the openness. I feel like I can breathe in here, you know? It's not some claustrophobic, little closet that smells like acetone. Room to grow. Dream big, I say.\n\nJimmy takes Kim on a tour around the empty suite.\n\nJIMMY: Got a decent-size conference room not as big as Hamlin's, but, you know, it's cozy. Our elderly brethren prefer that, I find.\n\nKIM: Could be cozier, though. Maybe you could embroider some little cushions, crochet a runner for the table.\n\nJIMMY: And rocking chairs all around?\n\nKIM: Yes. Make it look like the front of a cracker barrel, huh? Now you're talking.\n\nJimmy takes Kim into the office next to the conference room.\n\nJIMMY: This is me.\n\nKIM: I love it.\n\nJIMMY: Got to look successful to be successful. Am I right?\n\nKIM: Well, this definitely looks like success. Great view. Get you a big, fancy desk in here.\n\nJIMMY: Cocobolo desk.\n\nKIM: A what?\n\nJIMMY: I don't know what it means, but I just like saying the word cocobolo.\n\nKIM: Okay, well, whatever it is, you deserve it.\n\nJIMMY: And, uh, I want you to see this one.\n\nJimmy takes Kim to the corner office.\n\nJIMMY: Here we are.\n\nKIM: Whoa. This is way better than the other one.\n\nJIMMY: You think?\n\nKIM: Uh, yeah. Who goes in here? 'Cause I'd be all up in here if I were you.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah. Yeah, you know, you're right. It is real nice.\n\nKIM: It's a corner office. You got to go with the corner office.\n\nJIMMY: Eh, I was saving it for someone.\n\nKIM: Who?\n\nJIMMY: Well, my partner.\n\nKIM: Your partner? Who's... Who would that be?\n\nJIMMY: Well, you said you were interested in elder law.\n\nKIM: That's... That is so... Thank you. Really. But you know I've got a lot invested at HHM. With what's going on now, I'm closer than ever to partner like, maybe two years, and I'm in.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's... it's just a thought.\n\nKIM: Plus, you know, they put me through law school. I feel like I owe them. Actually, I do owe them literally, you know? But it's a nice thought, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: Just, uh, you know, playing with ideas. So, I had the extra office and everything, so. Yeah.\n\nKIM: Yeah. No, I get it. It's... I want to see the kitchen.\n\nKim leaves the office looking for the kitchen. Jimmy stays alone looking out the window.\n\nKIM (O.S): Wow! They have stainless in here. I don't even have stainless at home.\n\nINT. HHM - CONFERENCE ROOM\nKim and Mr. and Mrs. Kettleman sit around the table discussing their case.\n\nKIM: I know this is the last thing you want to hear. I think your chances of getting a favorable ruling from a jury are very slim.\n\nCRAIG: What does that mean?\n\nKIM: We're not in a great position to win at trial.\n\nBETSY: But we came to you people because we were told you win cases.\n\nKIM: Winning doesn't always mean getting a favorable verdict at trial. We try to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, given each individual case. Frankly, we've worked very hard to stave off an arrest. After the misunderstanding about your, uh, camping trip, the D.A. was concerned you might be a flight risk.\n\nBETSY: A flight risk? We we were practically in our own backyard.\n\nKIM: That's exactly what we told the D.A. In any case, I think we've managed to come up with a deal that is very favorable under the circumstances.\n\nBETSY: A deal? I hate that terminology. A deal is what they got O.J.\n\nCRAIG: Well, Betsy, maybe we should, you know, hear it.\n\nBETSY: I'm just saying, it's terrible term. What kind of deal?\n\nKIM: If the prosecution decides to file, which is definitely the direction this seems to be headed, and if they choose to stack charges, Craig, you're looking at 30 years in prison.\n\nCRAIG: 30 years?\n\nKIM: That's the maximum, and given the nature of the charge and the current political environment, I'd say we should expect it. The public outcry in cases like these is a big factor. However, after much discussion with the D.A., who is also invested in keeping the press to a minimum, we have arrived at an arrangement, which would include 16 months in a county facility.\n\nCRAIG: 16 months.\n\nKIM: Down from 30 years. And you most likely wouldn't serve all of it.\n\nBETSY: But he would have to say he was guilty.\n\nKIM: Admitting wrongdoing and making the county whole again goes a long way here... hence the minimal sentence.\n\nBETSY: Uh, \"making the county whole again\"?\n\nKIM: It includes the stipulation that you return $1.6 million in misappropriated funds.\n\nCRAIG: Give back the money?\n\nBetsy puts her hand on Craig's arm.\n\nBETSY: But there is no money.\n\nCRAIG: There's no money.\n\nBETSY: We told you Craig is innocent.\n\nKIM: I understand. However, I'd like to emphasize again that this deal is Craig's best chance of minimizing jail time.\n\nBETSY: You're telling us there are drug dealers and murderers walking the streets, but instead of going after them, they want to put an innocent man in jail.\n\nCRAIG: There's no other way?\n\nKIM: I'm sorry. I think, under the circumstances, this is your best option.\n\nBETSY: Murderers and rapists, and this is how they tr... (inhales deeply) Okay. There is no money. There never was. You have to take this to trial.\n\nKIM: Look, you have a difficult, but nevertheless straightforward choice to make here. On one hand, you give up the money, plead...\n\nBETSY: Ah! I just told you there is no money.\n\nKIM: Plead guilty... it's painful, I know and go to jail for a year and a half. But your other choice that is no choice at all. If you go to trial, you'll most likely lose, and Craig goes to prison for decades. Your children will grow up seeing their dad through bars on visiting day. I know what I'd do. I'd take the deal. Two years from now, you can be starting over. It's tough, I know, But you're tough people. And your family is worth it. Why don't I give you a few moments to discuss this? I know it's a big decision.\n\nBETSY: We don't need to discuss it. You're fired.\n\nINT. HHM LOBBY\nBetsy and Craig burst though the door and head downstairs towards the exit. Howard and Kim follow.\n\nHOWARD: How about we go to my office and discuss this? I'm sure there's a solution.\n\nBETSY: That won't be necessary. We will no longer be requiring your services.\n\nCRAIG: Yeah, it's not personal, really.\n\nHOWARD: If you're unhappy with what we presented to you, there may be other directions we can go.\n\nBETSY: We're done here! Please stop following us!\n\nCraig looks back at Howard, who stands on the staircase.\n\nBETSY: Don't look back.\n\nBETSY (O.S): Only look forward. Always in life, look forward.\n\nINT. BINGO\n\nJIMMY (O.S): O-70! O-70! Oh, yeah. 70's a good age. All right, duck your heads, 'cause here comes another number. N-32. And the action never stops. I hope you all took your heart pills, 'cause it's almost too much excitement, right?\n\nJIMMY: Which one will it be? Say your prayers. Here it comes. All right, we've got G-48 \"G,\" as in \"Guy Lombardo.\" G-48.\n\nJIMMY (O.S): Keep your elbows to yourselves, okay? No body-checking. All right, what do we have here? Wait for it. B-6. Lucky B-6, just like the vitamin, all right, which you should be taking. Keep things moving in the old G.I. tract.\n\nOLD LADY: Bingo!\n\nJIMMY (O.S): Oh, we have a winner!\n\nThe other bingo players give her a round of applause.\n\nJIMMY: Lady luck has struck again. Let's see a hand so we know who's won. Let's see a hand so we know who's won.\n\nThe lady raises her hand.\n\nJIMMY: It's the lovely young lady in the back. Congratulations, Miss. You've won a, um what do we have for the lovely lady?\n\nBINGO HELPER: Notebook.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, it's an adorable notebook. Do you like cats, Miss, uh...\n\nOLD LADY: Oh, Irene. I love kitties. I have two siamese cats, Oscar and Felix. Felix can wash himself. Oscar won't. He he just won't.\nJimmy's cellphone starts ringing. He reaches into his pocket for the phone.\n\nJIMMY: What a lovely story. Thank you.\n\nJimmy looks over to the helper.\n\nJIMMY: Um, can you take that to Irene? And when you come back, cover yeah?\n\nJimmy addresses the crowd, and then heads to the back of the room to answer his cellphone.\n\nJIMMY: Uh, I'm gonna take a short break, 'cause somebody needs legal help.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): (British accent) Offices of James McGill, esquire. How may I direct your call?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): (British accent) Yes. Yes. Yes, of course. Um, one moment, please.\n\nJimmy heads out of the door.\nINT. LOYOLA'S DINER\nJimmy sits down at a table with the Kettleman.\n\nJIMMY: D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Hello, again. Good to see you.\n\nCRAIG: Nice to see you.\n\nJIMMY: So, how may I be of service?\n\nBETSY: Well, we would like to hire you as our attorney, Mr. McGill.\n\nJIMMY: Wow. Really?\n\nBETSY: However, we have certain conditions, and these are not up for debate. We want no jail time. Zero. Craig is innocent, and we expect you to prove that. We won't see his name smeared like this any longer.\n\nJIMMY: Um, can we back up just a scooch? 'Cause last time we spoke, you were very enthusiastic... you were positively insistent about being represented by HHM.\n\nA waitress comes over to offer them coffee. Craig raises his mug ready to get some, but Betsy waves the waitress away.\n\nBETSY: Well, uh. We've parted ways.\n\nJIMMY: May I ask why?\n\nBETSY: We disagreed with their defense strategy.\n\nJIMMY: Okay.\n\nBETSY: They treated us like we were guilty.\n\nJIMMY: So, your previous objections to my representing you are now...\n\nBETSY: Oh, I'm sorry about my bluntness at our last encounter.\n\nCRAIG: Unfortunate.\n\nBETSY: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I...\n\nCRAIG: But we really we're very sorry about that.\n\nBETSY: We thought long and hard about it, and, um, we....\n\nCRAIG: And, you know, given your passion and your can-do attitude. We really.. we just believe that you're the lawyer for us.\n\nBETSY: For us, yes.\n\nJIMMY: Well, as flattered as I am by this, um, since we last spoke, I've changed my area of specialization, so I concentrate on elder law now.\n\nCRAIG: But, I mean, you said that you would fight for us. Yeah, you were you were adamant.\n\nBETSY: You promised to get us a not-guilty verdict.\n\nJIMMY: I don't think I exactly promised that.\n\nBETSY: You said we would be client number one, morning, noon, or night.\n\nJIMMY: Yes, and I meant what I said, at the time, but times change.\n\nBETSY: But we've already paid you a retainer.\n\nJIMMY: Right. A retainer.\n\nBETSY: That is what you called it. That was your specific terminology.\n\nJIMMY: It... could you excuse me for a moment? I, uh, had a big gulp on the way over.\n\nCRAIG: Ohh.\n\nINT. LOYOLA'S DINER - BATHROOM\nJimmy enters the bathroom and pulls out his cellphone, dialing Kim. Another man is also in the bathroom with his back to Jimmy.\n\nKIM (On phone): Hey.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Hey, there.\n\nThe other man stops urinating and turns to face Jimmy, who quickly turns his back and continues his conversation.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Funny story. I found something that belongs to you... again.\n\nKIM (On phone): Yeah? What?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Who? Picture \"The 25th Hour\", starring Ned and Maude Flanders.\n\nKIM (On phone): Oh, Christ. The Kettlemans?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): You lose any other clients today?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Yeah. Mr. and Mrs. Cuckoo Bananas just offered me the plum job of defending them.\n\nKIM (On phone): They came to you?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Yeah, I know. I don't know what you did to piss them off, but it must have been good.\n\nKIM (On phone): What did they tell you?\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Not much, just, uh, that you treated them like they were guilty.\n\nKIM (On phone): Jesus. Look, Jimmy I know... I know this is a lot to ask, but you have to convince them to come back to HHM.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): I do, huh?\n\nKIM (On phone): Yes. Please. It's important.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): What's it worth to you?\n\nThe other man finishes urinating and exits the bathroom, nudging Jimmy out of the way.\n\nKIM (On phone): Jimmy, I'm serious. They left because they think they can win this case, but they can't. I managed to scrape together from practically nothing, I might add a deal they should feel lucky to have. This is their absolute best bet. Please Make them understand it's better for them if they come back.\n\nJIMMY (On phone): Tell me about this deal.\n\nINT. LOYOLA'S DINER\n\nBETSY: Elder law?\n\nCRAIG: I don't know what that is.\n\nBETSY: Yeah, me neither. Elder. Do you think...\n\nCRAIG: Maybe if we were old.\n\nWe see Jimmy approaching in the background. He reaches the table and takes a seat.\n\nJIMMY: Sorry. Whoo! The mysteries of the bladder.\n\nCRAIG: Right?\n\nBETSY: So, how do we get started? Do you need us to sign that little paper?\n\nJIMMY: I am I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case. My schedule is just it's just chock-full right now. I highly encourage you to go back to HHM. I'm certain they would welcome you with open arms.\n\nBETSY: No, we're not going back there. They were incompatible.\n\nJIMMY: I understand. They asked you to face some harsh realities, and I get it no one likes that. But bottom line here Kim Wexler is a fine attorney. She has a great relationship with the D.A. Much as I'd love to sing my own praises, I doubt I could get you a deal as good as the one she already has.\n\nBETSY: Okay, we don't want a deal. We want you, our lawyer, to exonerate Craig.\n\nJIMMY: \"Exonerate\"? That is, uh that is a big word, particularly in your case.\n\nBETSY: Yeah, there will be no deal. There is no money with which to make a deal.\n\nJIMMY: We can we all three just parachute down from cloud cuckoo land? 'Cause we know, without question, there is money.\n\nBETSY: No, there...\n\nJIMMY: I distinctly remember a spirited game of tug-of-war over this money, money which we then discussed at length.\nYou made many excuses justifying your possession of said money. It's there. It exists.\n\nBETSY: But...\n\nJIMMY: S-shh. Now, just please, for my own sanity... You can't hide a big bag of cash forever, and you certainly will never be able to spend any of it. So, go back to HHM, apologize to Ms. Wexler, and for Christ's sakes, take the deal.\n\nBETSY: If there were any money.\n\nJIMMY: Lady, enough!\n\nBETSY: If there were any money, there would have to be a full accounting of it. Every penny would have to be present every single penny. You understand?\n\nCRAIG: All of it. That includes the $30,000 that you...\n\nBETSY: Craig, yes, he gets it. We're in this together, Mr. McGill Come what may. Now, where do we begin?\n\nINT. HHM\nHoward escorts Jimmy through HHM to Kim's office, where he collects the Kettleman case files.\n\nHOWARD: There you go. Kettleman that's all of it.\n\nJIMMY: Where's Kim?\n\nHOWARD: We moved her over to the east wing.\n\nJIMMY: The east wing? That's the cornfield. Why are you sending her to the cornfield, Howard?\n\nHOWARD: Never heard it called that before.\n\nJIMMY: Well, that's what you call it. You gonna punish her just 'cause you lost those two batshit Kettlemans? You notice I'm not exactly crowing over how I snaked them away from you.\n\nHOWARD: Jimmy, here are your files. I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.\n\nJIMMY: I'm gonna need some help here.\n\nHOWARD: Yeah... You sure are.\n\nHoward walks away.\nINT. HHM - ELEVATOR\nJimmy wheels the case files out of the elevator\nEXT. HHM - PARKING LOT\nJimmy wheels the case files into the parking lot and stands next to Kim, who\u2019s smoking a cigarette.\n\nJIMMY: That prick firing you?\n\nKIM: Best-case scenario is my 2-year plan just became a 10-year plan.\n\nJIMMY: That schmuck. You didn't do anything wrong.\n\nKIM: I lost the client.\n\nJIMMY: Not your fault. They're not really playing with a full deck those Kettlemans.\n\nKIM: You had to take their case?\n\nJIMMY: I'm sorry, okay? I tried. I really did.\n\nKIM: I'm not being fair. Of course you tried. They'll do what they want to do. Hope you didn't promise them too much. I doubt you'll be able to do more for them than we were offering.\n\nJIMMY: You think very highly of my skills, obviously.\n\nKIM: It's not that, Jimmy. It's a loser case. That deal was their best chance. After I worked my ass off finagling with the D.A., and it's just like... whatever.\n\nJIMMY: There's got to be a way, you know? I take it to court.\n\nKIM: You'll lose. Kettleman did a terrible job covering his tracks. For starters, they've got reams of checks he wrote for false expenses. And I can't even challenge their admission into evidence because he wrote them to himself. I know we're never supposed to say our clients are guilty, but, hey, not my client anymore. He's guilty as sin.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, but there has to be something... some loophole or...\n\nKIM: None that I could find.\n\nJIMMY: There has to be a way.\n\nKIM: Not without the money. It's the only chip those Kettlemans have, and they refuse to play it.\n\nINT. JIMMY'S OFFICE\nJimmy stays up late, looking over the case files, searching for a loophole. But he becomes frustrated, finding none. So he comes up with another plan. He looks up at the ceiling and climbs onto a chair, grabbing a box which he takes money out of.\nEXT. KETTLEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT\nWe watch the Kettleman's inside their living room from outside.\nMike in the backyard, sprays a fluorescent liquid on a stack of cash, and places it on a toy truck left outside by the Kettleman kids. He then surveys the house, while listening to his radio and eating apples he finds on a tree.\nMr. Kettleman then discovers the money when he takes out the trash, and brings it inside, where both, Mr. and Mrs. Kettleman tell off the kids for playing with the money and then finally Betsy takes the money upstairs.\nINT. KETTLEMAN HOUSE - NIGHT\nOnce the Kettleman's go to bed, Mike breaks into their house and uses a UV light to follow a trail of fingerprints left behind by Mrs. Kettleman after touching the money. The trail leads him to a bathroom cabinet, where he discovers all of the stolen money.\n\n[?]\nMike brings the cash to Jimmy, who returns what he\u2019s spent to the pile.\n\nJIMMY: Jesus. Gets bigger every time I look at it. Thanks for not heading to the Bahamas with this.\n\nMIKE: What are you doing?\n\nJIMMY: \"The right thing.\" You know where you're going?\n\nMIKE: Yeah. Am I correct in assuming we're now square?\n\nJIMMY: Square.\n\nMike picks up the money and goes to deliver it to the district attorney.\nINT. KETTLEMAN HOUSE\nThe Doorbell rings. Craig Kettleman answers the door.\n\nJIMMY: Good morning.\n\nBETSY (O.S): Who is it, Craig?\n\nCRAIG: Oh, it's Mr. McGill! Good morning. Come on in.\n\nJimmy steps inside and makes his way into the living room.\n\nJIMMY: Oh, I love what you've done with the place. Last time I was here, it was, uh, well, not a contender for the cover of good housekeeping... that's for sure.\n\nBETSY: Do you have news about our case?\n\nJIMMY: I do, in fact. But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.\n\nBETSY: Ah. We told you there will be no deal.\n\nJIMMY: You did, didn't you? However, circumstances have changed.\n\nBETSY: What circumstances?\n\nJIMMY: To answer that, um, might I suggest that you go check on that money you insist you didn't take?\n\nJIMMY: In the upstairs bathroom, under the sink?\n\nCRAIG: Wait. How could you... Betsy!\n\nBetsy and Craig both rush upstairs to bathroom, looking for the money.\n\nBETSY (O.S): No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No!\n\nCRAIG (O.S): It's okay. It's okay, Betsy. It's got to be... No. It's got to be in there somewhere.\n\nBetsy looks over the banister to Jimmy.\n\nBETSY: What did you do with it?\n\nJIMMY: By \"it,\" you mean...\n\nBETSY (O.S): Where is it?!\n\nBetsy and Craig both rush back downstairs to Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: Oh. You mean the money. Uh, let me see. Uh, it's, uh, on its way to the D. A.'s desk right about now.\n\nBETSY: What? You oh, you thief!\n\nJIMMY: Takes one to know one, doesn't it?\n\nCRAIG: He took it? How did you take it?\n\nJIMMY: A good magician never reveals his secrets. Now, here's what we're gonna do.\n\nBETSY: Oh, you don't tell us what to do. You stole from us. We'll... we will have you arrested.\n\nJIMMY: I can see how upset you are, and, even on a good day, you and logic are (whistles) but think about what you just said. Criminals have no recourse, and you two... you're criminals, big-time.\n\nBETSY: How dare you?\n\nJIMMY: Luckily, you have a very talented lawyer who has found a way to minimize the damage you've brought upon yourselves.\n\nBETSY: Oh. Oh, you're fired.\n\nJIMMY: Oh, I quit already. No, I'm talking about Kim Wexler. Now, you're gonna go back to her, you're gonna apologize for your hasty decision to terminate her services, and you're gonna fall on her mercy and take that deal.\n\nBETSY: We'll tell... about the bribe you took.\n\nJIMMY: You could do that. You absolutely could. And I'd be in a mess of trouble... a real pickle... but so would you, Mrs. Kettleman. 'Cause right now, only Mr. Kettleman is on the hook for the whole embezzlement kerfuffle. But the bribe we're back to calling it a bribe? Yeah, that implicates you, as well.\n\nCRAIG: It does not. It was all me.\n\nJIMMY: No, it wasn't. I'll make sure everyone knows that. Look on the bright side, you know? They could work out some kind of inter-prison visitation program, the occasional conjugal. Maybe it won't be all bad. (to Mrs. Kettleman) You? you'll probably wind up running your own gang. Thing you folks need to know about me... I got nothing to lose. Christ, you should see my office.\n\nCraig puts his hand on Betsy's shoulder.\n\nBETSY: No, it's not over.\n\nCRAIG: Yeah.\n\nBETSY: Let's find another lawyer.\n\nCRAIG: Come on, Betsy.\n\nBETSY: No, no. No. We don't have to put up with this. I will not be treated this way.\n\nCRAIG: Betsy. The kids.\n\nBETSY: The...\n\nCRAIG: We have to do this. For the kids. They can't lose us both.\n\nBetsy starts crying.\n\nCRAIG: We have to.\n\nBETSY: No.\n\nCRAIG: Shh.\n\nBETSY: (Sobbing) No.\n\nCRAIG: It's okay. It's okay. Shh.\n\nINT. HHM\nJimmy stands next to the dented trash waiting for the elevator doors to open. Once they open Kim comes into view, and she walks out into the parking lot, where the Kettleman's are waiting in the back of Jimmy's car.\nKim takes the Kettlemans upstairs in elevator, and mouths \u201cThank you\u201d to Jimmy as the doors close.\nINT. OFFICE SUITE\nJimmy returns to the office that he can no longer afford to lease, and stares sadly out its windows before taking out his frustration on the door to the corner office he hoped Kim would occupy.\nINT. OFFICE SUITE - CORNER OFFICE\nJimmy collapses onto the floor and looked at his wit\u2019s end, until his suddenly cellphone starts ringing. He manages to bring himself together, and answer the call.\n\nJIMMY: (British accent) Law offices of James M. McGill.

Aries moon]\nThe sun in Virgo and the moon in Aries\nCombines a critical ability\nWith an aggressive personality\nThe careful Virgin nature drops its guard under the influence of the speculating Ram\nAfter a few false starts, the drive toward personal recognition begins\nAnd the excellent metal equipment of Virgo, fired by the enthusiasm of Aries\nHelps desires to be realized\n\n[Nancy Priddy - Taurus moon]\nThe Virgin moon in Taurus softens the corners of ambition\nAnd usually the native likes the living to be easy\nYou're often fortunate in matters of money, and sheer luck seems to favor you\nYou prefer harmony to excitement, and have an aversion to being rushed\nYou are a great audience and both artists and life love to have you around\n\n[Michael Bell - Gemini moon]\nIt's been said that man is not a beast of pure reason alone\nThe Virgo with the Twin moon seems to learn everything but that\nYou are mostly education and information, but not very big in inspiration and imagination\nIf you think it, you believe it\nIf you feel it, you don't quite understand it\nIn the area of the mind, challenges get you going\nAnd there you are hard to defeat\nYour mind just never stops working\n\n[John Erwin - Cancer moon]\nIf you are a Virgo with a moon in Cancer, there's more to you than meets the eye\nYou appear aloof but respond quickly to a show of friendship\nYou seem to be practical and conservative, but time reveals a quivering sensitivity\nYour attitude impresses as conventional, but you can have things going that could raise eyebrows\nThese contradictions do not result from dishonesty, but from protection against a world you're not sure of\n\n[Nancy Priddy - Leo moon]\nI could not love thee dear so well, loved I not honor more\nThis quote sums up the Virgin with her moon in Leo\nYour character, sense of duty, and your need to be honorable mean more to you than anything else in the world\nYour difficulty comes from not understanding that you are pretty much alone in this competitive world\nYou can live and die by your standards\nWhile others, less able, succeed\nMuch to your amazement and resentment\n\n[Michael Bell - Virgo moon]\nThe sun and moon in Virgo produces an intellectual aristocrat\nYour thinking proceeds on classic lines, and your approach to living is impeccable\nTaste is your word\nAnd your creed\nAnd anything that violates good taste scrapes across your senses like a fingernail across a blackboard\nYou uphold the status quo, and violent changes in personal and world affairs is a condition and a fact of life you cannot buy\n\n[John Erwin - Libra moon]\nThe moon in Libra inspires refinement\nWhich heightens the fastidiousness of the Virgin nature\nOnly truly worthwhile pursuits can claim your time and your energy\nYou're discriminating, but are not a put down person\nIf you cannot associate with people you respect, you prefer your own company and the stimulation of a good book\nAny port in a storm is a philosophy you couldn't possibly abide\n[Nancy Priddy - Scorpio moon]\nIf you are a Virgo with your moon in Scorpio\nYour life is lived in extremely personal terms\nAnd all roads lead to you\nPassion dominates thought\nAnd a fiercely subjective attitude touches everything you do\nYour convictions are primarily emotional\nAnd as a result they're not easily changed\nWhen an idea you believe in is threatened, you feel your entire existence is in jeopardy\nThis could make you a rebel without a cause\n\n[Michael Bell - Sagittarius moon]\nThe critical faculty of the Virgin is challenged by the optimism of the Archer\nWhen the Virgo Moon is in Sagittarius\nYour mind may tell you \"no\", but what you feel is \"yes\"\nIn order to escape this paradox, you substitute dreams for reality\nIn fact, even give up on reality\nWhich, isn't necessary\nFor you have a practical and analytical potential\nWhich, when focused, can achieve first-rate results\n\n[John Erwin - Capricorn moon]\nWhen the Virgo Moon is in Capricorn, the exactness of the Virgin and the cautious ambition of the Goat combined to create a study in practicality\nYou are quietly straightforward\nAnd achieve by using precise knowledge, and subtle reasoning\nFinancial gains usually follow your efforts\nAnd business advancement seems to be the natural result\nYour assent, though extremely careful at times\nDoes lead to a personality and a style of living which is well integrated\n[Nancy Priddy - Aquarius moon]\nThe Aquarian's love of relating to life in the abstract is increased, when Virgo's Moon is in Aquarius\nYou not only feel a cause, but being Virgo, can examine it rationally\nAnd find ingenious original ways of presenting it\nIndividuals you can take or leave alone as a rule\nBut people, as a mass mirror of suffering humanity\nGet the most you have to give, which is usually a great deal\n\n[Michael Bell - Pisces moon]\nThe hairsplitting eye of the Virgin is given the third eye vision of the hypersensitive Fish, when the moon is in Pisces\nThere is the perfect equation of the factual and the intuitive\nA capacity for seeing beyond the obvious\nAnd reaching the spiritual essence of a problem or a human being\nThe most rewarding life you can live is one of sympathy, and charity\nWith an open ear, and open heart for anyone, at any time", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 504838, "name": "Mort Garson", "imageURL": "https://images.genius.com/816925058c04a490efb7f4d3692c7b28.403x403x1.jpg"}, "fullTitle": "Where Was Your Moon (Virgo) by Mort Garson", "releaseDateComponents": {"year": 1969, "month": null, "day": null}}, {"songID": 2149172, "lyrics": "2 ContributorsJ.A.P.A.N.

just let it through your head?\n\nAll the fucking years and I've still yet to feel\nLike anyone could give a fuck because I constantly deal\nWith the absence of importance, such a long lasting pain\nAll because you didn't want to be a father to me\n(you piece of shit)\nYou might also likeBecause of you my whole life has been hell to live\nI'm nothing close to a man and I got nothing to give\n(not even a man)\nI'm just so empty, so bitter and broken\n\nIt's not a grudge that I'm holding, it's the hatred that was born within\n\nYou gave up before you could even try\nFuck me for believing in you\nBut I just know; I don't get it, and I never will\nBecause this will never make\nSense to me\n\nI felt like a sick dog when you put me down\nYears later still standing take a look at

The Dragon Warrior\nfell out of the sky on a ball of\nfire.\n\nMANTIS\nWhen he walks, the very ground\nshakes!\n\nTIGRESS\nOne would think that Master Oogway\nwould choose someone who actually\nknew Kung Fu.\n\nCRANE\nYeah, or could at least touch his\ntoes.\n\nMONKEY\nOr even see his toes.\n\nAs the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them\nhas been walking behind them this whole time, hearing\neverything.\n\nHe attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts\nup his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls\nover.\n\n33.\n\n\nHe gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.\n\n\nINT. BUNKHOUSE\n\nPo peeks around the corner.\n\nPO\nOkay.\n\nHe tip-toes into the hall.\n\nSQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(whispering)\nGreat.\n\nPo takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes\nthrough the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!\nTHUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom\ndoor.\n\nCrane is staring back at him.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nOh hey...hi. You're up.\n\nCRANE\nAm now.\n\nPO\nI was just uh... Some day huh?\nThat kung fu stuff is hard work,\nright? Your biceps sore?\n\nCrane looks at his wing.\n\nCRANE\nUm...I've had a long and rather\ndisappointing day, so uh...yeah, I\nshould probably get to sleep now.\n\nPO\nYeah yeah yeah, of course.\n\nCRANE\n(relieved)\nOkay, thanks.\n\nPO\nIt's just...I'm such a big fan.\n\n34.\n\n\nCRANE\nOop.\n\nPO\nYou guys were totally amazing at\nthe Battle of Weeping River.\nOutnumbered a thousand to one, but\nyou didn't stop, and then you\njust... HI-YAH!\n\nPo does a spastic series of Kung Fu moves. We hear a RIP, and\nreveal that he's kicked his foot through the paper wall.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nOoo, sorry about that.\n\nCRANE\nLook, you don't belong here.\n\nPo looks stung to be hearing this from one of his heroes.\n\nPO\nI know. I know. You're right. I\njust - my whole life I've dreamed\nof-\n\nCrane stops Po before he embarrasses himself even more.\n\nCRANE\nNo no no... I meant you don't\nbelong here. I mean, in this room.\nThis is my room. Property of Crane.\n\nPo is mortified, but covers.\n\nPO\nOh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you\nwant to get to sleep.\n\nCRANE\nYeah.\n\nPO\nI'm keepin' you up. We got big\nthings tomorrow. Alright. You're\nawesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.\nOkay. Bye bye.\n\nPo shuts the door. Crane sighs. The door flies open. Po\nenters with an eager smile.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nWhat was that?\n\n35.\n\n\nCRANE\nI didn't say anything.\n\nPO\nOkay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep\nwell.\n\nPo backs out into the hall and closes the door.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nSeemed a little bit awkward.\n\nPo turns and walks down the hall to find a vacant room. CREAK-\nCREAK.\n\nTigress opens the door behind him. Po winces.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nMaster Tigress! Didn't mean to wake\nyou. Just uh...\n\nTIGRESS\nYou don't belong here.\n\nPO\nUh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is\nyour room.\n\nTIGRESS\nI mean...you don't belong in the\nJade Palace. You're a disgrace to\nKung Fu, and if you have any\nrespect for who we are and what we\ndo, you will be gone by morning.\n\nShe closes the door on Po, who slumps sadly.\n\nPO\nBig fan...\n\n\nEXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT\n\nA dejected Po stands under a peach tree in the moonlight.\nOogway approaches.\n\nOOGWAY\nI see you have found the Sacred\nPeach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.\n\nPo spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.\n\n36.\n\n\nPO\n(mouth full)\nIs that what this is? I am so\nsorry. I thought it was just a\nregular peach tree.\n\nOOGWAY\nI understand. You eat when you are\nupset.\n\nPO\nUpset? I'm not upset. What makes\nyou think I'm upset?\n\nOOGWAY\nSo why are you upset?\n\nPo sighs, there's no use trying to lie to Oogway.\n\nPO\nI probably sucked more today than\nanyone in the history of kung fu,\nin the history of China, in the\nhistory of sucking.\n\nOOGWAY\nProbably.\n\nPO\nAnd the Five... man, you should\nhave seen them, they totally hate\nme.\n\nOOGWAY\nTotally.\n\nPO\nHow's Shifu ever going to turn me\ninto the Dragon Warrior? I mean,\nI'm not like The Five. I've got no\nclaws, no wings, no venom. Even\nMantis has those...\n(he imitates a mantis'\nfront legs)\n...thingies. Maybe I should just\nquit and go back to making noodles.\n\nOOGWAY\nQuit, don't quit. Noodles, don't\nnoodles.\n\nPo looks confused.\n\n37.\n\n\nOOGWAY (CONT'D)\nYou are too concerned with what was\nand what will be. There is a\nsaying: Yesterday is history,\ntomorrow is a mystery, but today is\na gift. That is why it is called\nthe present.\n\nOogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a\npeach falls into Po's open hand.\n\n\nINT. PRISON -- NIGHT\n\nUsing the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS\nfree from his armor.\n\nAn ALARM RINGS OUT!\n\nThe Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.\n\nZENG\nWhat's happening?!\n\nThe Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom\nof the pit.\n\nTai Lung struggles with his shackles.\n\nCOMMANDER\nFire Crossbows!\n\nTai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and\nthen manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,\ncreating a makeshift staircase.\n\nZENG\nTai Lung is free! I must warn\nShifu!\n\nThe Commander shuts the Goose up.\n\nCOMMANDER\nYou're not going anywhere. And\nneither is he.\n\nZENG\nLet go of me!\n\nCOMMANDER\n(to guards)\nBring it up!\n\n38.\n\n\nThe winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino\nguard tries to reach it, but just misses.\n\nRHINO GUARD #1\nWait! Bring it back!\n\nZENG\nHe's coming this way!\n\nCOMMANDER\nHe won't get far.\n(to guards)\nArchers!\n\nLeaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as\nthe volley of arrows flies down past him.\n\nThe guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to\nthe bottom of the pit.\n\nTai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and\ncatches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps\nover the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the\nnext tier, disappearing into the shadows.\n\nTai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally\nreaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the\nRhino army await.\n\nZENG\nWe're dead. So very, very dead.\n\nThe Commander hushes the Goose.\n\nCOMMANDER\n(to Goose)\nHeh heh...not yet we're not! Now!\n\nArchers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites\ncrash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps\nacross the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump\ntowards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and\nsparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs\nmaniacally.\n\nOn his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning\ndown to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the\nraining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.\n\nGrabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it\nahead of him at the guards.\n\nZENG\nCan we run now?\n\n39.\n\n\nCOMMANDER\nYes.\n\n\nEXT. PRISON\n\nKA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying\neverywhere.\n\nWHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn\nprosthetic falls in front of him.\n\nZENG\nNuuu... Urggg...\n\nTai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.\n\nZENG (CONT'D)\nURRK!\n\nTAI LUNG\nI'm glad Shifu sent you. I was\nbeginning to think I had been\nforgotten.\n\nWith a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's\nruffled feathers.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nFly back there and tell them...the\nreal Dragon Warrior is coming home.\n\nTai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.\nLightning strikes.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. BUNKHOUSE - MORNING\n\nCLOSE-UP of a gong being struck.\n\n\nINT. BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nShifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out\nof their rooms and land, ready for inspection.\n\nFURIOUS FIVE\nGood morning master!\n\nOne door remains closed.\n\n40.\n\n\nSHIFU\nPanda! Panda, wake up!\n\nHe slides open Po's door. The room is empty.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\n(satisfied)\nHmm. He's quit.\n\n\nEXT. TRAINING HALL - MOMENTS LATER\n\nShifu walks with a bit more energy.\n\nVIPER\nWhat do we do now, Master? With the\npanda gone, who will be the Dragon\nWarrior?\n\nSHIFU\nAll we can do is resume our\ntraining and trust that in time,\nthe true Dragon Warrior will be\nrevealed.\n\n\nINT. JADE PALACE - MOMENTS LATER\n\nShifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-\nface with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.\n\nSHIFU\nWhat are you doing here?!\n\nReveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide\napart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the\nFive enter the hall.\n\nPO\nHey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I\nthought I'd warm up a little.\n\nSHIFU\nYou're stuck.\n\nPO\nStuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...\nYeah, I'm stuck.\n\nSHIFU\n(to Crane)\nHelp him.\n\nCrane approaches Po.\n\n41.\n\n\nCRANE\nOh dear.\n\nCrane gingerly grabs Po's waistband and attempts to pull him\nup by flapping his wings.\n\nPO\nMaybe on three. One. Two-\n\nCrane pulls him up and Po flops onto his back.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nThreeeee. Thank you.\n\nCRANE\nDon't mention it.\n\nPO\nNo really, I appreci--\n\nCRANE\n--EVER.\n\nSHIFU\nYou actually thought you could\nlearn to do a full split in one\nnight? It takes years to develop\none's flexibility and years longer\nto apply it in combat.\n\nShifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress\nleaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.\nAs Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around\nPo, knocking him on the head.\n\nPo collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu\nnotices and steps forward.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nPut that down! The only souvenirs\nwe collect here are bloody knuckles\nand broken bones.\n\nPO\nYeah, excellent!\n\nHe laughs excitedly and salutes Shifu.\n\nSHIFU\nLet's get started.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n42.\n\n\nMONTAGE\n\nShifu snaps his fingers. Viper and Po face off.\n\nVIPER\nAre you ready?\n\nPO\nI was born ready--\n\nViper lashes her tail around Po's wrist, wrenches his arm\nback, flings him into the air and brings him crashing back\ndown on his head.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nEaghhh...\n\nVIPER\nI'm sorry, brother! I thought you\nsaid you were ready!\n\nPO\nThat was awesome! Let's go again.\n(salutes)\n\nShifu snaps.\n\nMonkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a\ncomical beating.\n\nShifu snaps.\n\nPo and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po\nfalls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.\n\nShifu snaps.\n\nWe see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the\nhands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...\nMantis.\n\nShifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu\nhas had it.\n\nSHIFU\nI've been taking it easy on you,\npanda, but no more! Your next\nopponent... will be me.\n\nPo looks excited.\n\nPO\nAlright! Let's go!\n\n43.\n\n\nThe Five exchange worried looks.\n\nSHIFU\n(to Po)\nStep forth.\n\nPo doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around\nand throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nThe true path to victory is to find\nyour opponent's weakness and make\nhim suffer for it.\n\nPO\n(delighted)\nOh, yeah!\n\nShifu whips Po around again.\n\nSHIFU\nTo take his strength and use it\nagainst him.\n\nAgain, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\n--until he finally falls, or quits.\n\nPo is totally inspired.\n\nPO\nBut a real warrior never quits.\nDon't worry, Master, I will never\nquit!\n\nAt his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then\nleaps at him with a flying kick.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. TRAINING HALL - CONTINUOUS\n\nPo crashes out of the door and tumbles down the steps.\n\nThe Five watch him fall.\n\nTIGRESS\nIf he's smart, he won't come back\nup those steps.\n\nMONKEY\nBut he will.\n\n44.\n\n\nVIPER\nHe's not gonna quit, is he?\n\nMANTIS\nHe's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll\ntell ya that.\n\nCut WIDE as Po continues to tumble.\n\n\nINT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING\n\nClose on Po, who grimaces.\n\nPO (O.S.)\nAaaoo...whoohoo...EEEee...hee-\nhee... I thought you said\nacupuncture would make me feel\nbetter.\n\nMantis pops up from behind Po holding a handful of needles\nand sticks Po again.\n\nMANTIS\nTrust me, it will. It's just not\neasy finding the right nerve points\nunder all this--\n\nPO\nFat?\n\nMANTIS\nFur, I was gonna say fur.\n\nPO\nSure you were.\n\nMANTIS\nWho am I to judge a warrior based\non his size? I mean -- look at me.\n\nPo looks for Mantis...\n\nMANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)\nI'm over here.\n\n...But Mantis is now on his other shoulder. He jabs another\nneedle into Po.\n\nPO\nOw!\n\n45.\n\n\nVIPER\nMaybe you should take a look at\nthis again.\n\nViper is holding a diagram of acupuncture meridians (onto\nwhich someone has overlaid a drawing of a panda.)\n\nMANTIS\n(re: diagram)\nOh! Okay.\n\nQuick cuts to Monkey meditating in his room and Crane doing\ncalligraphy in his. Po's yelps distract them.\n\nPO\nOw! Don't...\n(laughing)\nStop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master\nShifu's trying to inspire me and\nall, but if I didn't know any\nbetter, I'd say he was trying to\nget rid of me.\n\nPo chuckles. The others look at each other and chuckle\nawkwardly.\n\nMANTIS\nI know he can seem kind of\nheartless--\n\nHe violently jabs another needle in Po.\n\nMANTIS (CONT'D)\nBut, ya know, he wasn't always like\nthat.\n\nVIPER\nAccording to legend, there was once\na time when Master Shifu actually\nused to smile.\n\nPO\nNo.\n\nMANTIS\nYes.\n\nCut to Tigress out in the hallway. She can hear them talking.\n\nVIPER\nBut that was before...\n\nPO\nBefore what?\n\n46.\n\n\nTigress enters.\n\nTIGRESS\nBefore Tai Lung.\n\nCrane's shadow is silhouetted on the wall.\n\nCRANE\nUh yeah, we're not really supposed\nto talk about him.\n\nTIGRESS\nWell, if he's going to stay here,\nhe should know.\n\nPO\n(trying to ease the\ntension)\nGuys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.\n\nTigress turns to Po.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nHe was a student, the first ever to\nmaster the thousand...\n\nTigress approaches Po and leans in towards him.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(nervously trailing off)\n...scrolls of... kung fu... and...\nthen he turned bad... and now he's\nin jail.\n\nTigress shakes her head at the panda's ignorance.\n\nTIGRESS\nHe wasn't just a student.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT. TRAINING HALL\n\nFLASHBACK. Shifu peeks out of the Training Hall and finds a\nbaby leopard cub on the steps.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.)\nShifu found him as a cub. And he\nraised him as a son.\n\nBaby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.\n\n47.\n\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n...and when the boy showed talent\nin Kung Fu...\n\nBaby Tai Lung punches the training dummy across the floor.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n...Shifu trained him.\n\nShifu teaches Baby Tai Lung how to punch.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nHe believed in him. He told him he\nwas destined for greatness.\n\nHard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training\ndummy.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nIt was never enough for Tai Lung.\nHe wanted the Dragon Scroll. But\nOogway saw darkness in his heart\nand refused. Outraged, Tai Lung\nlaid waste to the valley. He tried\nto take the scroll by force. And\nShifu had to destroy what he had\ncreated.\n\nTai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.\nHe crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu\nand Oogway.\n\nShifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nBut how could he?\n\nSeeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls\nhis kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike\nand Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.\n\nTai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with\nstrikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a\nheap.\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nShifu loved Tai Lung like he'd\nnever loved anyone before...\n\nYoung Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the\nsame manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing\nmore. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.\n\n48.\n\n\nTIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n...or since.\n\nThe sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.\n\n\nINT. BUNKHOUSE - EVENING\n\nEveryone is quiet in the moment.\n\nTIGRESS\nAnd now he has a chance to make\nthings right, to train the true\nDragon Warrior. And he's stuck with\nyou: a big, fat panda who treats it\nlike a joke.\n\nPo makes a googly-eyed face.\n\nPO\nDoieeeee...\n\nTIGRESS\n(charging at Po)\nOh! That is it!\n\nMantis pops up and halts Tigress.\n\nMANTIS\nWait! My fault! I accidentally\ntweaked his facial nerve.\n\nPo falls face first to the floor, revealing his back is\ncovered with needles.\n\nMANTIS (CONT'D)\nAnd may have also stopped his\nheart.\n\n\nINT. TRAINING HALL - NIGHT\n\nShifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.\n\nSHIFU\nInner peace. Inner peace. Inner\npeace.\n\nHe finally opens one eye.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nWould whoever is making that\nflapping sound, quiet down!\n\n49.\n\n\nSatisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his\nmeditation.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nInner...\n\nBOOM.

JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING\n\nOogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu\nrushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.\n\nSHIFU\nMaster! Master!\n\nOOGWAY\nHmmm?\n\nSHIFU\n(out of breath)\nI have-- it's-- it's very bad news.\n\nOOGWAY\nAh, Shifu. There is just news.\nThere is no good or bad.\n\nSHIFU\nMaster, your vision...your vision\nwas right. Tai Lung has broken out\nof prison. He's on his way!\n\nOOGWAY\nThat is bad news...\n\nHe turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.\n\nOOGWAY (CONT'D)\n...If you do not believe that the\nDragon Warrior can stop him.\n\nSHIFU\nThe panda? Master, that panda is\nnot the Dragon Warrior.\n(MORE)\n\n50.\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nHe wasn't even meant to be here --\nit was an accident!\n\nOOGWAY\nThere are no accidents.\n\nSHIFU\nYes, I know. You've said that\nalready. Twice.\n\nOOGWAY\nWell, that was no accident either.\n\nSHIFU\nThrice.\n\nOOGWAY\nMy old friend, the panda will never\nfulfill his destiny, nor you yours,\nuntil you let go of the illusion of\ncontrol.\n\nSHIFU\nIllusion?\n\nOOGWAY\nYeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I\ncannot make it blossom when it\nsuits me, nor make it bear fruit\nbefore its time.\n\nSHIFU\nBut there are things we can\ncontrol.\n\nShifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nI can control when the fruit will\nfall.\n\nA peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses\nthe peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nAnd I can control--\n\nShifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed\nin it.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\n--where to plant the seed. That is\nno illusion, Master.\n\n51.\n\n\nOOGWAY\nAh, yes. But no matter what you do,\nthat seed will grow to be a peach\ntree. You may wish for an apple, or\nan orange... but you will get a\npeach.\n\nSHIFU\nBut a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!\n\nOOGWAY\nMaybe it can. If you are willing to\nguide it, to nurture it. To believe\nin it.\n\nOogway covers the seed with dirt.\n\nSHIFU\nBut how? How? I need your help,\nMaster.\n\nOOGWAY\nNo, you just need to believe.\nPromise me, Shifu. Promise me you\nwill believe.\n\nSHIFU\nI... I will try.\n\nOogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to\nShifu.\n\nOOGWAY\nGood. My time has come. You must\ncontinue your journey without me.\n\nHe hands his staff to a confused Shifu.\n\nSHIFU\nWhat... what are you..?\n\nOogway backs away into the swirling fog.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nMaster, you can't leave me!\n\nThe petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.\n\nOOGWAY\nYou must believe.\n\nSHIFU\nMaster!\n\n52.\n\n\nShifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.\nAs the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge\nof a cliff.\n\nOogway is gone.\n\nWe pan across to the bunkhouse.\n\nPO (O.S.)\n...So I'm like, fine, you may be a\nwolf, you may be the scariest\nbandit in Haijin Province...\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\nReveal Po is cooking for the Five. He chops some veggies mid-\nair.\n\nPO\n...but you're a lousy tipper.\n\nCRANE\n(incredulous)\nReally? So... how'd you get out of\nthere alive?\n\nPO\nI mean, I didn't actually say that,\nbut I thought it... in my mind.\n\nPo flips some bowls and expertly lines them up on his arm. He\nladles soup into them.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(covering)\nIf he... could read my mind, he'd\nhave been like, \"What?\"\n(then)\nOrder up!\n\nPo looks around expectantly and the Five (minus Tigress) dig\nin.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nHope you like it.\n\nMANTIS\nThis is really good.\n\nPO\n(bashful)\nNo, c'mon.\n(MORE)\n\n53.\nPO (CONT'D)\nYou should try my dad's secret\ningredient soup. He actually knows\nthe secret ingredient.\n\nVIPER\nWhat are you talking about? This is\namazing.\n\nCRANE\nWow, you're a really good cook.\n\nMANTIS\nI wish my mouth was bigger.\n\nThe others laugh. But not Tigress.\n\nMONKEY\nTigress, you gotta try this.\n\nTigress looks up from her meal.\n\nTIGRESS\nIt is said that the Dragon Warrior\ncan survive for months at a time on\nnothing but the dew of a single\ngingko leaf and the energy of the\nuniverse.\n\nOn the others for a beat. Then Po shrugs.\n\nPO\nI guess my body doesn't know it's\nthe Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna\nneed a lot more than dew. And, uh,\nuniverse juice.\n\nPo laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When\nhe lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --\nit looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nWhat?\n\nMANTIS\nOh, nothing... Master Shifu!\n\nThe rest start laughing. Po realizes he's wearing a noodle\nmoustache. He plays it up.\n\n54.\n\n\nPO\n(imitating Shifu)\nYou will never be the Dragon\nWarrior, unless you lose five\nhundred pounds and brush your\nteeth!\n\nThe Five LAUGH.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(imitating Shifu)\nWhat is that noise you're making?\nLaughter? I never heard of it!\n\nThe Five keep LAUGHING. Po reaches over and grabs two empty\nbowls and holds them up like ears.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(imitating Shifu)\nWork hard, Panda. And maybe,\nsomeday... you will have ears like\nmine.\n\nAs the rest of the Five laugh, Tigress sneaks a moment to\nsmell Po's soup. Leaning towards the bowl, she suddenly looks\nup and stops. The Five also look up and stop laughing.\n\nReveal Shifu has entered behind Po. He is holding Oogway's\nstaff.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(normal)\nEars. It's not working for you? I\nthought they were pretty good.\n\nPo looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.\n\nMONKEY\nIt's Shifu.\n\nPO\nOf course it's Shifu. What do you\nthink I'm doing?\n\nHe finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn.\nEmbarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a\nbra.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nOoh! Master Shifu!\n\nPo slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but\nsnicker.\n\n55.\n\n\nSHIFU\nYou think this is funny? Tai Lung\nhas escaped from prison and you're\nacting like children!\n\nPO\nWhat?\n\nSHIFU\nHe is coming for the Dragon Scroll,\nand you are the only one who can\nstop him.\n\nThe bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts\nto laugh.\n\nPO\nAnd here I am saying you got no\nsense of humor. I'm gonna stop\nTai...\n\nShifu just stares at him, deadly serious.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nWhat? You're serious? And I have to--\nuh, Master Oogway will stop him! He\ndid it before, he'll do it again.\n\nSHIFU\nOogway cannot, not anymore.\n\nThey notice Shifu holding Oogway's staff. They know what this\nmeans. They are saddened by the news.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nOur only hope is the Dragon\nWarrior.\n\nTIGRESS\nThe panda?\n\nSHIFU\nYes, the panda!\n\nTIGRESS\nMaster, please. Let us stop Tai\nLung. This is what you've trained\nus for.\n\nSHIFU\nNo! It is not your destiny to\ndefeat Tai Lung. It is his.\n\nHe dramatically points at Po... but Po is gone.\n\n56.\n\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nWhere'd he go?\n\nShifu throws up his hands in frustration and heads after Po.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. BUNKHOUSE \u00ad DAY\n\nSuper wide shot as Po runs away from the compound. Closer as\nhe continues running. He checks over his shoulder, turns\nback... Shifu lands right in front of him.\n\nSHIFU\nYou cannot leave! A real warrior\nnever quits!\n\nPO\nWatch me!\n\nHe tries to maneuver around Shifu, but is redirected back.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nCome on! How am I supposed to beat\nTai Lung? I can't even beat you to\nthe stairs.\n\nSHIFU\nYou will beat him because you are\nthe Dragon Warrior!\n\nHe pushes Po back with the staff.\n\nPO\nOw! You don't believe that! You\nnever believed that! From the first\nmoment I got here, you've been\ntrying to get rid of me.\n\nShifu pokes him again, this time causing Po to fall on his\nback.\n\nSHIFU\nYes. I was. But now I ask you to\ntrust in your master as I have come\nto trust in mine.\n\nPO\nYou're not my master. And I'm not\nthe Dragon Warrior.\n\nPo shoves the staff away and gets up.\n\n57.\n\n\nSHIFU\nThen why didn't you quit? You knew\nI was trying to get rid of you, and\nyet you stayed.\n\nPO\nYeah, I stayed. I stayed because\nevery time you threw a brick at my\nhead or said I smelled, it hurt.\nBut it could never hurt more than\nit did every day of my life just\nbeing me.\n\nPo looks down at the Valley, then turns back to Shifu.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nI stayed because I thought if\nanyone could change me, could make\nme... not me, it was you. The\ngreatest kung fu teacher in all of\nChina.\n\nSHIFU\nBut I can change you! I can turn\nyou into the Dragon Warrior! And I\nwill!\n\nPO\nC'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here\nright now. And even if it takes him\na hundred years to get here, how\nare you gonna change this...\n(indicate belly)\n...into the Dragon Warrior? How?\nHow? How?!\n\nIn frustration, Shifu yells out the answer.\n\nSHIFU\nI don't know!!!\n(then, resigned)\nI don't know.\n\nPO\nThat's what I thought.\n\nShifu walks away, leaving the path open to Po.\n\n\nEXT. JADE PALACE - NIGHT\n\nTigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. She has\nseen what just transpired between Shifu and Po.\n\n58.\n\n\nShe turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS.\n\nShe flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in\nthe valley below. She looks back up at the palace.\n\nTIGRESS\nThis is what you trained me for.\n\nShe takes off running.\n\nThe other four are right behind her.\n\nVIPER\nTigress!\n\nShe keeps going and they give chase.\n\nTIGRESS\nDon't try and stop me!\n\nThe chase continues through the village.\n\nVIPER\nWe're not trying to stop you!\n\nTIGRESS\nWhat?\n\nVIPER\nWe're coming with you!\n\nThen...the others join her. Tigress smiles. They leap off\ninto the night.\n\n\nEXT. JADE PALACE - EVENING\n\nNight dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He\nstirs, hearing KUNG FU NOISES from the training hall. He goes\nto investigate.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nINT. TRAINING HALL - DAWN\n\nShifu looks inside -- it's empty. The NOISES continue from\nsomewhere else -- the bunkhouse.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n59.\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN - DAWN\n\nAs Shifu turns the corner he sees Po's shadow as he performs\nsome amazing Kung Fu.\n\nEntering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face\nwith food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.\n\nIn silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --\nbroken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.\n\nPO\n(mouth full)\nWhat? I eat when I'm upset, okay?\n\nShifu gets a glimmer in his eye. He has an idea.\n\nSHIFU\nOh, no need to explain. I just\nthought you might be Monkey -- he\nhides his almond cookies on the top\nshelf.\n\nShifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,\nwaiting to see if his hunch is correct.\n\nKLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po\nperched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his\nmouth. Po notices Shifu walking back in.\n\nPO\n(mouth full)\nDon't tell Monkey.\n\nHe glances back down at Shifu, whose disbelief turns to a\nwise smile.\n\nSHIFU\nLook at you.\n\nPO\nYeah, I know. I disgust you.\n\nSHIFU\nNo no, I mean... how did you get up\nthere?\n\nPO\nI don't know. I guess I-- I don't\nknow. I was getting a cookie...\n\nHe looks at the cookie and then can't help but eat it.\n\n60.\n\n\nSHIFU\nAnd yet you are ten feet off the\nground and have done a perfect\nsplit.\n\nPO\nNo, this... this is just an\naccident.\n\nHe and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po\nslips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over\nto Shifu. He picks it up.\n\nSHIFU\nThere are no accidents. Come with\nme.\n\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAWN\n\nShifu leads Po through the mountains.\n\nPO\nI know you're trying to be all\nmystical and kung fu-y, but could\nyou at least tell me where we're\ngoing?\n\nShifu just continues walking.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - LATER\n\nShifu is sitting beneath a tree. Winded and wheezing, Po\nslowly works his way up the hill.\n\nPo sets his gear down and looks around. Shifu breathes in the\nmorning mist as Po approaches.\n\nPO\nYou dragged me all the way out here\nfor a bath?!\n\nPo begins to pat his armpits with water.\n\nSHIFU\nPanda, we do not wash our pits in\nThe Pool of Sacred Tears.\n\nPo quickly stops. Realizing.\n\n61.\n\n\nPO\n(in awe)\nThe pool of...\n\nSHIFU\nThis is where Oogway unravelled the\nmysteries of harmony and focus.\nThis is the birthplace of Kung Fu.\n\nThe camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock\nshapes that resemble a yin yang symbol.\n\nAs the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a\nvision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves.\n\nFLASH FRAME -- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks\ndown at Po.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nDo you want to learn Kung Fu?\n\nPO\n(awestruck)\nYeah...\n\nSHIFU\nThen I am your master!\n\nPO\nOkay!\n\nTears of joy well up in Po's eyes.\n\nSHIFU\nDon't cry.\n\nPO\nOkay.\n\nPo sniffs the tears back and smiles.\n\n\nEXT. FIELD - LATER\n\nShifu leads Po out into an open field.\n\nSHIFU\nWhen you focus on Kung Fu, when you\nconcentrate...you stink.\n\nPo scowls.\n\n62.\n\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nBut perhaps that is my fault. I\ncannot train you the way I have\ntrained the Five. I now see that\nthe way to get through to you is\nwith this!\n\nShifu produces a bowl of dumplings.\n\nPO\nOh great, `cause I'm hungry.\n\nSHIFU\nGood. When you have been trained,\nyou may eat. Let us begin.\n\n\nEXT. FIELD - LATER\n\nPo's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance\ntests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc. Through it all, he\nnever gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu.\n\n\nEXT. CLEARING - A MOMENT LATER\n\nShifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder.\n\nSHIFU\nAfter you, panda.\n\nPo stops short, suspicious.\n\nPO\nJust like that? No situps? No ten\nmile hike?\n\nSHIFU\nI vowed to train you... and you\nhave been trained. You are free to\neat.\n\nPo grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nEnjoy.\n\nPo raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches\nthe dumpling away and eats it himself.\n\nPO\nHey!\n\n63.\n\n\nSHIFU\nI said you are free to eat. Have a\ndumpling.\n\nPo reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks\nthe dumpling into the air.\n\nPO\nHey!\n\nShifu eats it and Po scowls.\n\nSHIFU\nYou are free to eat!\n\nPO\n(upset)\nAm I?\n\nSHIFU\n(challenging)\nAre you?!\n\nPo and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and\nsends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and\nShifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one\nleft.\n\nShifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He\nhides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks\nas weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with\nhis bamboo staff.\n\nBut Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final\ndumpling.\n\nShifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.\n\nBut then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.\n\nPO\nI'm not hungry... master.\n\nMaster and pupil bow to each other.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. MOUNTAIN PASS\n\nThe Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain\npeaks.\n\n64.\n\n\nTai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and\nraces toward them.\n\nTIGRESS\nCut it!\n\nThe others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the\nmountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the\nfinal rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch\nherself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the\nbridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The\nFive grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.\n\nTAI LUNG\nWhere's the Dragon Warrior?\n\nTIGRESS\nHow do you know you're not looking\nat her?\n\nTai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.\n\nTAI LUNG\nYou think I'm a fool? I know you're\nnot the Dragon Warrior. None of\nyou!\n\nThe Five exchange quick, worried looks.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\n(nodding confidently)\nI heard how he fell out of the sky\non a ball of fire, that he's a\nwarrior unlike anything the world\nhas ever seen.\n\nThe Five exchange quick, confused looks.\n\nMONKEY\nPo?\n\nTAI LUNG\nSo that is his name -- Po. Finally,\na worthy opponent. Our battle will\nbe legendary!\n\nTigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches\nTai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters\nwith a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through\nthe bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the\nbridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.\n\nMONKEY\nWe've got this. Help her!\n\n65.\n\n\nViper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the\nropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane\nmanages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with\nhis own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's\n\"throat\".\n\nVIPER\nMonkey!\n\nANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the\nrope by himself.\n\nMANTIS\nGo!\n(then)\nAck! What was I thinking?!\n\nMonkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and\nsending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets\nback to his feet and starts running back to them on a single\nstrand of rope.\n\nTIGRESS\nMantis!\n\nMantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave\nshooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face\nand he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.\n\nTIGRESS (CONT'D)\nNow!\n\nWorking as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which\nway. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai\nLung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.\nMantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies\nsafely to the mountain.\n\nThe Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...\n\nTigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling\nthe far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope\nwhips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.\n\nWith a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.\n\nTAI LUNG\nShifu taught you well...\n\nTai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nBut he didn't teach you everything.\n\n66.\n\n\nTai lung lunges toward the rest.\n\n\nEXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING\n\nShifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an\neasy spring in his step.\n\nSHIFU\nYou have done well, Panda.\n\nPO\nDone well? Done well?! I've done\nawesome!\n\nHe swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.\n\nShifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.\n\nSHIFU\nThe mark of a true hero is\nhumility!\n\nAfter a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nBut yes...you have done awesome.\n\nAnd he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As\nthey LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind\nthem. IT'S CRANE!\n\nCrane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a\nheap.\n\nPO\nHuh? Guys? Guys!\n\nPo throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nThey're dead? No, they're\nbreathing! They're asleep?! No,\ntheir eyes are open.\n\nCrane struggles to lift his head.\n\nCRANE\nWe were no match for his nerve\nattack.\n\nHis head collapses to the ground.\n\n67.\n\n\nSHIFU\nHe has gotten stronger.\n\nPO\nWho? Tai Lung? Stronger?\n\nShifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then\nMonkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -\n\nMONKEY\nHe's too fast!\n\nHe delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly\nrealizes where he is.\n\nMONKEY (CONT'D)\nSorry, Po.\n\nShifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.\n\nTIGRESS\nI thought we could stop him.\n\nSHIFU\nHe could have killed you.\n\nMANTIS\nWhy didn't he?\n\nSHIFU\nSo you could come back here and\nstrike fear into our hearts. But it\nwon't work!\n\nPO\nUh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm\npretty scared.\n\nSHIFU\nYou can defeat him, panda.\n\nPO\nAre you kidding? If they can't--\nThey're five masters. I'm just one\nme.\n\nSHIFU\nBut you will have the one thing\nthat no one else does.\n\n68.\n\n\nINT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\nCLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then\nlooks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -\n\nPO\nYou really believe I'm ready?\n\nSHIFU\nYou are, Po.\n\nThey look at each other. This is a big moment.\n\nOogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po\nand The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the\nreflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still\nclosed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the\nothers watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a\nflickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle\ntornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the\nDragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's\nmouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out\nwith the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns\nto Po, holding it out.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nBehold. The Dragon Scroll... It is\nyours.\n\nPO\nWait, what happens when I read it?\n\nSHIFU\nNo one knows, but legend says you\nwill be able to hear a butterfly's\nwing-beat.\n\nPO\nWhoa! Really? That's cool.\n\nSHIFU\nYes. And see light in the deepest\ncave. You will feel the universe in\nmotion around you.\n\nPO\nWow! Can I punch through walls?\nCan I do a quadruple back flip?\nWill I have invisibility--\n\nSHIFU\nFocus. Focus.\n\n69.\n\n\nPO\nHuh? Oh, yeah... yeah.\n\nSHIFU\nRead it, Po, and fulfill your\ndestiny. Read it and become... the\nDragon Warrior!\n\nPO\nWhooaa!!!\n\nPo takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to\npull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nIt's impossible to open.\n\nHe strains again. He tries to bite it off...\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nCome on baby. Come on now...\n\nShifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.\nShifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nThank you. I probably loosened it\nup for you though... Okay, here\ngoes.\n\nHe glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him\nthe `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden\nlight bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,\nexcited that he is witness to history...\n\nOn Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.\n\nThen -\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\n\nShifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks\nutterly terrified.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nIt's blank!\n\nSHIFU\nWhat?\n\nPO\nHere! Look!\n\n70.\n\n\nPo tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and\nturns his head away.\n\nSHIFU\nNo! I am forbidden to look upon--\n\nBut he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if\noff Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it\nand opens it again, astonished.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nBlank? I don't...I don't\nunderstand.\n\nShifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?\n\nPO\nOkay. So like, Oogway was just a\ncrazy old turtle after all?\n\nSHIFU\nNo. Oogway was wiser than us all.\n\nPo sits heavily on the floor, dejected.\n\nPO\nOh, come on! Face it. He picked me\nby accident. Of course I'm not the\nDragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?\n\nThe Five don't argue.\n\nTIGRESS\nBut who will stop Tai Lung?\n\nCRANE\nHe'll destroy everything...and\neveryone.\n\nShifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He\nlooks oddly calm as he turns around.\n\nSHIFU\nNo, evacuate the Valley. You must\nprotect the villagers from Tai\nLung's rage.\n\nTIGRESS\nWhat about you master?\n\nSHIFU\nI will fight him.\n\n71.\n\n\nPO\nWhat?\n\nSHIFU\nI can hold him off long enough for\neveryone to escape.\n\nPO\nBut Shifu, he'll kill you.\n\nSHIFU\nThen I will finally have paid for\nmy mistake.\n\nThe Five and Po look devastated.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nListen to me, all of you. It is\ntime for you to continue your\njourney without me. I am very proud\nto have been your master.\n\nShifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane\nsteps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.\n\nPo resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT.

Let's find your\nmama.\n\nTIGRESS\nViper, gather the southern farmers.\nMantis, the north. Crane, light the\nway.\n\nThey split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is\nleft by himself.\n\nHe makes his way through the bustling town.\n\n72.\n\n\nJR SHAW\n(skeptically)\nLook, it's the Dragon Warrior.\n\nPo approaches the Noodle Shop.\n\nPO\nHey, Dad.\n\nPO'S DAD\nPo!\n\nSeeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around\nhis son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad\npulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.\n\nPO'S DAD (CONT'D)\nGood to have you back, son!\n\nPO\n(listlessly)\nGood to be back.\n\nPo's Dad goes back to packing things up.\n\nPO'S DAD\nLet's go Po. So, for our next shop,\nit's time to face it -- the future\nof noodles is dice-cut vegetables,\nno longer slices.\n\nDad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.\n\nPO'S DAD (CONT'D)\nAlso, I was thinking, maybe this\ntime we'll have a kitchen you can\nactually stand up in. Hmm? You like\nthat?\n\nHe turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po\nsympathetically.\n\nPO'S DAD (CONT'D)\nPo, I'm sorry things didn't work\nout. It just... wasn't meant to be.\n\nPo slumps against the cart.\n\nPO'S DAD (CONT'D)\nPo, forget everything else. Your\ndestiny still awaits.

Honestly,\nsometimes I can't believe I'm\nactually your son.\n\nDad is taken aback.\n\nPO'S DAD\nPo, I think it's time I told you\nsomething I should have told you a\nlong time ago...\n\nPO\nOkay.\n\nDad pauses dramatically.\n\nPO'S DAD\nThe secret ingredient of my secret\ningredient soup!\n\nPo feigns excitement.\n\nPO\nOh.\n\nPO'S DAD\nC'mere! The secret ingredient is...\nnothing!\n\nPO\nHuh?\n\nPO'S DAD\nYou heard me. Nothing. There is no\nsecret ingredient!\n\nPO\nWait wait...it's just plain old\nnoodle soup? You don't add some\nkind of special sauce or something?\n\nPO'S DAD\nDon't have to. To make something\nspecial, you just have to believe\nit's special.\n\nPo looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up\nthe Scroll.\n\nFor a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then\nhe smiles serenely. He gets it now.\n\n74.\n\n\nPO\nThere is no secret ingredient...\n\nPo turns back to look at the palace.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\nEXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN\n\nAt the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,\nawaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears\nbefore him.\n\nTAI LUNG\nI have come home, Master.\n\nSHIFU\nThis is no longer your home. And I\nam no longer your master.\n\nTAI LUNG\nYes. You have a new favorite. So\nwhere is this...Po? Did I scare him\noff?\n\nSHIFU\nThis battle is between you and me.\n\nTAI LUNG\nSo. That is how it's going to be?\n\nSHIFU\nThat is how it must be.\n\nThey fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the\ndoors of the Jade Palace.\n\nTai Lung enters.\n\nTAI LUNG\nI rotted in jail for twenty years\nbecause of your weakness!\n\nSHIFU\nObeying your master is not\nweakness!\n\nTAI LUNG\nYou knew I was the Dragon Warrior!\nYou always knew...\n\nDissolve to FLASHBACK.\n\n75.\n\n\nA young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.\n\nTAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)\nBut when Oogway said otherwise,\nwhat did you do? What did you do?!\n\nTai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past\ndissolves into the present.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nNOTHING!\n\nShifu takes a Kung Fu stance.\n\nSHIFU\nYou were not meant to be the Dragon\nWarrior! That was not my fault!\n\nTAI LUNG\nNOT YOUR FAULT?!\n\nEnraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and\nthrows them at Shifu.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nWHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!\nWHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY\nBONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY\nDESTINY?!\n\nShifu dodges each attack.\n\nSHIFU\nIt was never my decision to make!\n\nTai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.\n\nTAI LUNG\nIt is now.\n\nThey fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nGive me the scroll!\n\nSHIFU\nI would rather die.\n\nThey struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters\ninto a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a\nflutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu\ngets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.\n\n76.\n\n\nShifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and\nsends them both crashing through the roof.\n\nLightning flash.\n\nGrappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's\nthroat as they crash back through the roof.\n\nThey kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.\nTai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the\nfloor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he\ncharges at Shifu.\n\nTAI LUNG\nAll I ever did, I did to make you\nproud! Tell me how proud you are,\nShifu! Tell me! TELL ME!\n\nTHOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor\nand crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames\nextinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.\n\nSHIFU\n(weakly)\nI have always been proud of you.\nFrom the first moment, I've been\nproud of you. And it was my pride\nthat blinded me. I loved you too\nmuch to see what you were becoming.\nWhat I was turning you into. I'm...\nsorry.\n\nTai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's\nexpression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.\n\nTAI LUNG\nI don't want your apology. I want\nmy scroll!\n\nHe holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung\nbristles when he sees the scroll is missing.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nWHAT? WHERE IS IT?!\n\nTai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.\n\nSHIFU\n(weakly)\nDragon Warrior has taken scroll\nhalfway across China by now. You\nwill never see that scroll, Tai\nLung. Never. Never...\n\n77.\n\n\nTai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.\nSuddenly...\n\nPO (O.S.)\nHey!\n\nTai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\n(out of breath)\nStairs...\n\nTai Lung casts Shifu aside.\n\nTAI LUNG\nWho are you?\n\nPO\nBuddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.\n(exhales hard)\nHuhhh...\n\nTAI LUNG\nYou?! Him?!\n(to Shifu)\nHe's a panda.\n(back to Po)\nYou're a panda. What are you gonna\ndo, big guy? Sit on me?\n\nPO\nDon't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna\nuse this. You want it? Come and get\nit.\n\nPo shows him the Dragon Scroll.\n\nFrom out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across\nthe room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.\n\nTAI LUNG\nFinally!\n\nPo bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,\nsending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and\nstrikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to\nrun.\n\nTai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace\nsteps.\n\nPo clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends\nhim crashing onto the theater rooftops below.\n\n78.\n\n\nPo rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and\nsmash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes\nright back at Po.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nThat scroll is mine!\n\nDown the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the\nscroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down\nstairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down\non Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the\nscroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po\nsnatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies\ntowards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,\nbut Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart\nwhich see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the\nnoodle.\n\nUp and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees\nand into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the\nstreet.\n\nAs Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array\nof overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around\nto hide the scroll.\n\nPO\nLightning!\n\nTai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po\nuses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes\nout the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll\nrolls down the steps towards the river.\n\nPo gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases\ndown the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the\nfireworks-filled sky.\n\nPo slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The\nscroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an\nornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who\nsees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-\nvision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is\nshocked.\n\nTAI LUNG\nThe scroll has given him power.\n(then)\nNOOO0!!\n\nHe takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting\nshockwave collapses the building.\n\n79.\n\n\nAmazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach\nthe scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and\nunleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the\nground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating\npunch.\n\nAs the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the\nimpact crater.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\n(out of breath)\nFinally... oh yes... the power of\nthe Dragon Scroll... is mine!\n\nTai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.\n\nTAI LUNG (CONT'D)\nIt's NOTHING!!\n\nPo stirs.\n\nPO\nIt's okay. I didn't get it the\nfirst time either.\n\nTAI LUNG\n(disbelief)\nWhat?\n\nPo gets to his feet.\n\nPO\nThere is no secret ingredient. It's\njust you.\n\nTai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.\n\nTAI LUNG\nRRRAAAH!\n\nPO\nAAAAGGGHH!\n\nTai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nStop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!\nDon't! Don't!\n\nTai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he\ndelivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.\n\n80.\n\n\nThe shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms\ncome back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing\nback into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what\nhe just did.\n\nTai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po\nstrikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even\ngetting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai\nLung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai\nLung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po\nprepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!\nHe is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until\nfinally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the\nground.\n\nTai Lung is battered, but still defiant.\n\nTAI LUNG\n(heavy breathing)\nYou... can't defeat me. You're just\na big, fat panda!\n\nSCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.\n\nPO\nI'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the\nbig, fat panda.\n\nPo's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.\n\nTAI LUNG\nThe Wuxi Finger Hold!\n\nPO\nOh, you know this hold?\n\nTAI LUNG\nYou're bluffing. You're bluffing!\nShifu didn't teach you that.\n\nPO\nNope. I figured it out.\n\nHe flexes his pinky...\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nSkadoosh!\n\nKA-THOOM!\n\n81.\n\n\nEXT. VALLEY OF PEACE\n\nA mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the\nFurious Five and the fleeing villagers.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER\n\nVillagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist\nlooking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.\n\nKG SHAW\nLook! The Dragon Warrior.\n\nAs he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and\nhis scarf is a torn apron.\n\nVillagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the\ncrowd.\n\nPO'S DAD\nThat's my boy. That big, lovely\nkung fu warrior is my son!\n\nPO\nThanks, Dad.\n\nPo hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the\nground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest\nof the Five are with him. Po takes notice.\n\nPO (CONT'D)\nHey, guys.\n\nTIGRESS\nMaster.\n\nTigress bows deeply. The others follow.\n\nFURIOUS FIVE\nMaster.\n\nPO\n(modest)\nMaster?\n(then, remembering)\nMaster Shifu!\n\nPo races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then\nmore steps.\n\n82.\n\n\nINT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER\n\nPo arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still\nlying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his\nside.\n\nPO\nMaster! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?\n\nShifu weakly opens his eyes.\n\nSHIFU\nPo! You're alive!\n(then, darkly)\nOr we're both dead.\n\nPO\nNo, Master, I didn't die. I\ndefeated Tai Lung!\n\nSHIFU\nYou did?!\n\nShifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.\n\nSHIFU (CONT'D)\nWow. It is as Oogway foretold --\nYou are the Dragon Warrior. You\nhave brought peace to this Valley.\nAnd to me. Thank you. Thank you,\nPo. Thank you...\n\nShifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.\n\nPO\nNo! Master! No No No! Don't die,\nShifu. Please...\n\nSHIFU\n(eyes snapping open)\nI'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,\nDragon Warrior. I'm simply at\npeace. Finally.\n\nPO\nOh. So, um, I should...stop\ntalking?\n\nSHIFU\nIf you can.\n\nPo nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and\npupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back\naway from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.\n\n83.\n\n\nHe's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets\nfor a beat, then can't control himself any longer.\n\nPO\nWant to get something to eat?\n\nSHIFU\n(sighs)\nYeah.\n\nIRIS OUT.\n\nTHE END5", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 2201511, "name": "DreamWorks", "imageURL": "https://images.genius.com/62ac8d135ab0683a958167c096eda2b2.1000x1000x1.png"}, "fullTitle": "Kung Fu Panda (Script) by DreamWorks", "releaseDateComponents": null}, {"songID": 3281303, "lyrics": "\n[Chorus]\nPull up in a phantom when it's dark outside\nPull up at the party when it's dark outside\nAll of these people they down to ride\nLook at my eyes\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\n\n[Verse 1]\nKeepin' it real I say how I feel\nShoutout my old management, you missed on a mil\nI'm worth a mil, a couple of million\nFuck all these rappers, they all are my children\nAll of these dinosaurs old as fuck talkin down on me\nYou know it's a shame\nI guess they scared of me cause now that I am around\nTheir money isn't the same\nDid it with no favors had enough pull that\nI could of pulled me up a train\nShout out to Snake\nThat's my brother for life\nGood or bad times you know we cannot break\nHit after hit after hit hit after hit\nYou know we never gon' miss\nAnd if you're wondering why my fans love me so much\nCause you know I be writing my own shit\nAnd my girl showed me her DMs\nYou suckers need to really go get your own bitch\nAll of these artists they play me their music\nI laugh because they don't really own shit\n\n[Chorus]\nPull up in a phantom when it's dark outside\nPull up at the party when it's dark outside\nAll of these people they down to ride\nLook at my eyes\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey be the fakest I be the realest\nAll of my fans they be throwin their 4s at my shows and I kill it\nThey sing all my lyrics, I be the trillest\nYou lying to yourself\nFuck you and your mama if you say you don't feel this\nFuck em all, fuck em all, fuck em all\nSwear that they never believed me\nNow when I walk in these labels\nJust look at how the fuck they all treat me\nThese rappers they all wanna be me\nOn blood, I swear they cannot see me\nI just pulled up in a foreign surrounded by sqaures, like I'm coppin' a TV\nI put myself on ain't waitin' on Flom\nGetting more pussy than your girl's tampon\nNow let's get it on\nHer face got more babies than a Fetty song\nShe said this is her song\nAte me a steak then I fed her a bone\nIf your money short we can't get along\nLeave me alone\n[Chorus]\nPull up in a phantom when it's dark outside\nPull up at the party when it's dark outside\nAll of these people they down to ride\nLook at my eyes\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no\nNo no no5", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 62375, "name": "GASHI", "imageURL": "https://images.genius.com/9141949ebddceee9b53f13e952bf92cd.676x676x1.jpg"}, "fullTitle": "No No No by GASHI", "releaseDateComponents": {"year": 2017, "month": 10, "day": 20}}, {"songID": 159173, "lyrics": "1 ContributorTable Talk (Vol II Essay III) LyricsOn Going a Journey\n\nOne of the pleasantest things in the world is going a journey; but I like to go by myself. I can enjoy society in a room; but out of doors, nature is company enough for me. I am then never less alone than when alone.\n\n The fields his study, nature was his book.\n\nI cannot see the wit of walking and talking at the same time. When I am in the country I wish to vegetate like the country. I am not for criticising hedge-rows and black cattle. I go out of town in order to forget the town and all that is in it. There are those who for this purpose go to watering-places, and carry the metropolis with them. I like more elbow-room and fewer encumbrances. I like solitude, when I give myself up to it, for the sake of solitude; nor do I ask for\n\n A friend in my retreat,\n Whom I may whisper solitude is sweet.\n\nThe soul of a journey is liberty, perfect liberty, to think, feel, do, just as one pleases. We go a journey chiefly to be free of all impediments and of all inconveniences; to leave ourselves behind much more to get rid of others. It is because I want a little breathing-space to muse on indifferent matters, where Contemplation\n\n May plume her feathers and let grow her wings,\n That in the various bustle of resort\n Were all too ruffled, and sometimes impair'd,\n\nthat I absent myself from the town for a while, without feeling at a loss the moment I am left by myself. Instead of a friend in a postchaise or in a Tilbury, to exchange good things with, and vary the same stale topics over again, for once let me have a truce with impertinence. Give me the clear blue sky over my head, and the green turf beneath my feet, a winding road before me, and a three hours' march to dinner\u2014and then to thinking! It is hard if I cannot start some game on these lone heaths. I laugh, I run, I leap, I sing for joy. From the point of yonder rolling cloud I plunge into my past being, and revel there, as the sun-burnt Indian plunges headlong into the wave that wafts him to his native shore. Then long-forgotten things, like 'sunken wrack and sumless treasuries,' burst upon my eager sight, and I begin to feel, think, and be myself again. Instead of an awkward silence, broken by attempts at wit or dull common-places, mine is that undisturbed silence of the heart which alone is perfect eloquence. No one likes puns, alliterations, antitheses, argument, and analysis better than I do; but I sometimes had rather be without them. 'Leave, oh, leave me to my repose!' I have just now other business in hand, which would seem idle to you, but is with me 'very stuff o' the conscience.' Is not this wild rose sweet without a comment? Does not this daisy leap to my heart set in its coat of emerald? Yet if I wore to explain to you the circumstance that has so endeared it to me, you would only smile. Had I not better then keep it to myself, and let it serve me to brood over, from here to yonder craggy point, and from thence onward to the far-distant horizon? I should be but bad company all that way, and therefore prefer being alone. I have heard it said that you may, when the moody fit comes on, walk or ride on by yourself, and indulge your reveries. But this looks like a breach of manners, a neglect of others, and you are thinking all the time that you ought to rejoin your party. 'Out upon such half-faced fellowship,' say I. I like to be either entirely to myself, or entirely at the disposal of others; to talk or be silent, to walk or sit still, to be sociable or solitary. I was pleased with an observation of Mr. Cobbett's, that 'he thought it a bad French custom to drink our wine with our meals, and that an Englishman ought to do only one thing at a time.' So I cannot talk and think, or indulge in melancholy musing and lively conversation by fits and starts. 'Let me have a companion of my way,' says Sterne, 'were it but to remark how the shadows lengthen as the sun declines.' It is beautifully said; but, in my opinion, this continual comparing of notes interferes with the involuntary impression of things upon the mind, and hurts the sentiment. If you only hint what you feel in a kind of dumb show, it is insipid: if you have to explain it, it is making a toil of a pleasure. You cannot read the book of nature without being perpetually put to the trouble of translating it for the benefit of others. I am for this synthetical method on a journey in preference to the analytical. I am content to lay in a stock of ideas then, and to examine and anatomise them afterwards. I want to see my vague notions float like the down of the thistle before the breeze, and not to have them entangled in the briars and thorns of controversy. For once, I like to have it all my own way; and this is impossible unless you are alone, or in such company as I do not covet. I have no objection to argue a point with any one for twenty miles of measured road, but not for pleasure. If you remark the scent of a bean-field crossing the road, perhaps your fellow-traveller has no smell. If you point to a distant object, perhaps he is short-sighted, and has to take out his glass to look at it. There is a feeling in the air, a tone in the colour of a cloud, which hits your fancy, but the effect of which you are unable to account for. There is then no sympathy, but an uneasy craving after it, and a dissatisfaction which pursues you on the way, and in the end probably produces ill-humour. Now I never quarrel with myself, and take all my own conclusions for granted till I find it necessary to defend them against objections. It is not merely that you may not be of accord on the objects and circumstances that present themselves before you\u2014 these may recall a number of objects, and lead to associations too delicate and refined to be possibly communicated to others. Yet these I love to cherish, and sometimes still fondly clutch them, when I can escape from the throng to do so. To give way to our feelings before company seems extravagance or affectation; and, on the other hand, to have to unravel this mystery of our being at every turn, and to make others take an equal interest in it (otherwise the end is not answered), is a task to which few are competent. We must 'give it an understanding, but no tongue.' My old friend Coleridge, however, could do both. He could go on in the most delightful explanatory way over hill and dale a summer's day, and convert a landscape into a didactic poem or a Pindaric ode. 'He talked far above singing.' If I could so clothe my ideas in sounding and flowing words, I might perhaps wish to have some one with me to admire the swelling theme; or I could be more content, were it possible for me still to hear his echoing voice in the woods of All-Foxden.(1) They had 'that fine madness in them which our first poets had'; and if they could have been caught by some rare instrument, would have breathed such strains as the following:\u2014\n\n Here be woods as green\n As any, air likewise as fresh and sweet\n As when smooth Zephyrus plays on the fleet\n Face of the curled streams, with flow'rs as many\n As the young spring gives, and as choice as any;\n Here be all new delights, cool streams and wells,\n Arbours o'ergrown with woodbines, caves and dells;\n Choose where thou wilt, whilst I sit by and sing,\n Or gather rushes to make many a ring\n For thy long fingers; tell thee tales of love,\n How the pale Phoebe, hunting in a grove,\n First saw the boy Endymion, from whose eyes\n She took eternal fire that never dies;\n How she convey'd him softly in a sleep,\n His temples bound with poppy, to the steep\n Head of old Latmos, where she stoops each night,\n Gilding the mountain with her brother's light,\n To kiss her sweetest.(2)\nHad I words and images at command like these, I would attempt to wake the thoughts that lie slumbering on golden ridges in the evening clouds: but at the sight of nature my fancy, poor as it is, droops and closes up its leaves, like flowers at sunset. I can make nothing out on the spot: I must have time to collect myself.\n\nIn general, a good thing spoils out-of-door prospects: it should be reserved for Table-talk. Lamb is for this reason, I take it, the worst company in the world out of doors; because he is the best within. I grant there is one subject on which it is pleasant to talk on a journey, and that is, what one shall have for supper when we get to our inn at night. The open air improves this sort of conversation or friendly altercation, by setting a keener edge on appetite. Every mile of the road heightens the flavour of the viands we expect at the end of it. How fine it is to enter some old town, walled and turreted, just at approach of nightfall, or to come to some straggling village, with the lights streaming through the surrounding gloom; and then, after inquiring for the best entertainment that the place affords, to 'take one's ease at one's inn'! These eventful moments in our lives' history are too precious, too full of solid, heartfelt happiness to be frittered and dribbled away in imperfect sympathy. I would have them all to myself, and drain them to the last drop: they will do to talk of or to write about afterwards. What a delicate speculation it is, after drinking whole goblets of tea\u2014\n\n The cups that cheer, but not inebriate\u2014\n\nand letting the fumes ascend into the brain, to sit considering what we shall have for supper\u2014eggs and a rasher, a rabbit smothered in onions, or an excellent veal-cutlet! Sancho in such a situation once fixed on cow-heel; and his choice, though he could not help it, is not to be disparaged. Then, in the intervals of pictured scenery and Shandean contemplation, to catch the preparation and the stir in the kitchen (getting ready for the gentleman in the parlour). Procul, O procul este profani! These hours are sacred to silence and to musing, to be treasured up in the memory, and to feed the source of smiling thoughts hereafter. I would not waste them in idle talk; or if I must have the integrity of fancy broken in upon, I would rather it were by a stranger than a friend. A stranger takes his hue and character from the time and place; he is a part of the furniture and costume of an inn. If he is a Quaker, or from the West Riding of Yorkshire, so much the better. I do not even try to sympathise with him, and he breaks no squares. (How I love to see the camps of the gypsies, and to sigh my soul into that sort of life. If I express this feeling to another, he may qualify and spoil it with some objection.) I associate nothing with my travelling companion but present objects and passing events. In his ignorance of me and my affairs, I in a manner forget myself. But a friend reminds one of other things, rips up old grievances, and destroys the abstraction of the scene. He comes in ungraciously between us and our imaginary character. Something is dropped in the course of conversation that gives a hint of your profession and pursuits; or from having some one with you that knows the less sublime portions of your history, it seems that other people do. You are no longer a citizen of the world; but your 'unhoused free condition is put into circumspection and confine.' The incognito of an inn is one of its striking privileges\u2014'lord of one's self, uncumbered with a name.' Oh! it is great to shake off the trammels of the world and of public opinion\u2014to lose our importunate, tormenting, everlasting personal identity in the elements of nature, and become the creature of the moment, clear of all ties\u2014to hold to the universe only by a dish of sweetbreads, and to owe nothing but the score of the evening\u2014and no longer seeking for applause and meeting with contempt, to be known by no other title than the Gentleman in the parlour! One may take one's choice of all characters in this romantic state of uncertainty as to one's real pretensions, and become indefinitely respectable and negatively right-worshipful. We baffle prejudice and disappoint conjecture; and from being so to others, begin to be objects of curiosity and wonder even to ourselves. We are no more those hackneyed common-places that we appear in the world; an inn restores us to the level of nature, and quits scores with society! I have certainly spent some enviable hours at inns\u2014sometimes when I have been left entirely to myself, and have tried to solve some metaphysical problem, as once at Witham Common, where I found out the proof that likeness is not a case of the association of ideas\u2014at other times, when there have been pictures in the room, as at St. Neot's (I think it was), where I first met with Gribelin's engravings of the Cartoons, into which I entered at once, and at a little inn on the borders of Wales, where there happened to be hanging some of Westall's drawings, which I compared triumphantly (for a theory that I had, not for the admired artist) with the figure of a girl who had ferried me over the Severn, standing up in a boat between me and the twilight\u2014at other times I might mention luxuriating in books, with a peculiar interest in this way, as I remember sitting up half the night to read Paul and Virginia, which I picked up at an inn at Bridgewater, after being drenched in the rain all day; and at the same place I got through two volumes of Madame D'Arblay's Camilla. It was on the 10th of April 1798 that I sat down to a volume of the New Eloise, at the inn at Llangollen, over a bottle of sherry and a cold chicken. The letter I chose was that in which St. Preux describes his feelings as he first caught a glimpse from the heights of the Jura of the Pays de Vaud, which I had brought with me as a bon bouche to crown the evening with. It was my birthday, and I had for the first time come from a place in the neighbourhood to visit this delightful spot. The road to Llangollen turns off between Chirk and Wrexham; and on passing a certain point you come all at once upon the valley, which opens like an amphitheatre, broad, barren hills rising in majestic state on either side, with 'green upland swells that echo to the bleat of flocks' below, and the river Dee babbling over its stony bed in the midst of them. The valley at this time 'glittered green with sunny showers,' and a budding ash-tree dipped its tender branches in the chiding stream. How proud, how glad I was to walk along the high road that overlooks the delicious prospect, repeating the lines which I have just quoted from Mr. Coleridge's poems! But besides the prospect which opened beneath my feet, another also opened to my inward sight, a heavenly vision, on which were written, in letters large as Hope could make them, these four words, LIBERTY, GENIUS, LOVE, VIRTUE; which have since faded into the light of common day, or mock my idle gaze.\n\n The beautiful is vanished, and returns not.\n\nStill I would return some time or other to this enchanted spot; but I would return to it alone. What other self could I find to share that influx of thoughts, of regret, and delight, the fragments of which I could hardly conjure up to myself, so much have they been broken and defaced. I could stand on some tall rock, and overlook the precipice of years that separates me from what I then was. I was at that time going shortly to visit the poet whom I have above named. Where is he now? Not only I myself have changed; the world, which was then new to me, has become old and incorrigible. Yet will I turn to thee in thought, O sylvan Dee, in joy, in youth and gladness as thou then wert; and thou shalt always be to me the river of Paradise, where I will drink of the waters of life freely!\n\nThere is hardly anything that shows the short-sightedness or capriciousness of the imagination more than travelling does. With change of place we change our ideas; nay, our opinions and feelings. We can by an effort indeed transport ourselves to old and long-forgotten scenes, and then the picture of the mind revives again; but we forget those that we have just left. It seems that we can think but of one place at a time. The canvas of the fancy is but of a certain extent, and if we paint one set of objects upon it, they immediately efface every other. We cannot enlarge our conceptions, we only shift our point of view. The landscape bares its bosom to the enraptured eye, we take our fill of it, and seem as if we could form no other image of beauty or grandeur. We pass on, and think no more of it: the horizon that shuts it from our sight also blots it from our memory like a dream. In travelling through a wild barren country I can form no idea of a woody and cultivated one. It appears to me that all the world must be barren, like what I see of it. In the country we forget the town, and in town we despise the country. 'Beyond Hyde Park,' says Sir Topling Flutter, 'all is a desert.' All that part of the map that we do not see before us is blank. The world in our conceit of it is not much bigger than a nutshell. It is not one prospect expanded into another, county joined to county, kingdom to kingdom, land to seas, making an image voluminous and vast; the mind can form no larger idea of space than the eye can take in at a single glance. The rest is a name written in a map, a calculation of arithmetic. For instance, what is the true signification of that immense mass of territory and population known by the name of China to us? An inch of pasteboard on a wooden globe, of no more account than a China orange! Things near us are seen of the size of life: things at a distance are diminished to the size of the understanding. We measure the universe by ourselves, and even comprehend the texture of our being only piecemeal. In this way, however, we remember an infinity of things and places. The mind is like a mechanical instrument that plays a great variety of tunes, but it must play them in succession. One idea recalls another, but it at the same time excludes all others. In trying to renew old recollections, we cannot as it were unfold the whole web of our existence; we must pick out the single threads. So in coming to a place where we have formerly lived, and with which we have intimate associations, every one must have found that the feeling grows more vivid the nearer we approach the spot, from the mere anticipation of the actual impression: we remember circumstances, feelings, persons, faces, names that we had not thought of for years; but for the time all the rest of the world is forgotten!\u2014To return to the question I have quitted above:\n\nI have no objection to go to see ruins, aqueducts, pictures, in company with a friend or a party, but rather the contrary, for the former reason reversed. They are intelligible matters, and will bear talking about. The sentiment here is not tacit, but communicable and overt. Salisbury Plain is barren of criticism, but Stonehenge will bear a discussion antiquarian, picturesque, and philosophical. In setting out on a party of pleasure, the first consideration always is where we shall go to: in taking a solitary ramble, the question is what we shall meet with by the way. 'The mind is its own place'; nor are we anxious to arrive at the end of our journey. I can myself do the honours indifferently well to works of art and curiosity. I once took a party to Oxford with no mean eclat\u2014showed them that seat of the Muses at a distance,\n\n With glistering spires and pinnacles adorn'd\u2014\n\ndescanted on the learned air that breathes from the grassy quadrangles and stone walls of halls and colleges\u2014was at home in the Bodleian; and at Blenheim quite superseded the powdered Cicerone that attended us, and that pointed in vain with his wand to commonplace beauties in matchless pictures. As another exception to the above reasoning, I should not feel confident in venturing on a journey in a foreign country without a companion. I should want at intervals to hear the sound of my own language. There is an involuntary antipathy in the mind of an Englishman to foreign manners and notions that requires the assistance of social sympathy to carry it off. As the distance from home increases, this relief, which was at first a luxury, becomes a passion and an appetite. A person would almost feel stifled to find himself in the deserts of Arabia without friends and countrymen: there must be allowed to be something in the view of Athens or old Rome that claims the utterance of speech; and I own that the Pyramids are too mighty for any single contemplation. In such situations, so opposite to all one's ordinary train of ideas, one seems a species by one's-self, a limb torn off from society, unless one can meet with instant fellowship and support. Yet I did not feel this want or craving very pressing once, when I first set my foot on the laughing shores of France. Calais was peopled with novelty and delight. The confused, busy murmur of the place was like oil and wine poured into my ears; nor did the mariners' hymn, which was sung from the top of an old crazy vessel in the harbour, as the sun went down, send an alien sound into my soul. I only breathed the air of general humanity. I walked over 'the vine-covered hills and gay regions of France,' erect and satisfied; for the image of man was not cast down and chained to the foot of arbitrary thrones: I was at no loss for language, for that of all the great schools of painting was open to me. The whole is vanished like a shade. Pictures, heroes, glory, freedom, all are fled: nothing remains but the Bourbons and the French people!\u2014There is undoubtedly a sensation in travelling into foreign parts that is to be had nowhere else; but it is more pleasing at the time than lasting. It is too remote from our habitual associations to be a common topic of discourse or reference, and, like a dream or another state of existence, does not piece into our daily modes of life. It is an animated but a momentary hallucination. It demands an effort to exchange our actual for our ideal identity; and to feel the pulse of our old transports revive very keenly, we must 'jump' all our present comforts and connections. Our romantic and itinerant character is not to be domesticated. Dr. Johnson remarked how little foreign travel added to the facilities of conversation in those who had been abroad. In fact, the time we have spent there is both delightful, and in one sense instructive; but it appears to be cut out of our substantial, downright existence, and never to join kindly on to it. We are not the same, but another, and perhaps more enviable individual, all the time we are out of our own country. We are lost to ourselves, as well as our friends. So the poet somewhat quaintly sings:\n\n Out of my country and myself I go.\n\nThose who wish to forget painful thoughts, do well to absent themselves for a while from the ties and objects that recall them; but we can be said only to fulfil our destiny in the place that gave us birth. I should on this account like well enough to spend the whole of my life in travelling abroad, if I could anywhere borrow another life to spend afterwards at home!\n\nFootnotes\n(1) Near Nether-Stowey, Somersetshire, where the author of this Essay visited Coleridge in 1798.

You cannot hurt a Twinkie!\n\nApu picks it up and it pops back into shape.\nHe puts it back, then notices a strange smell.\nOn one shelf a packet of ham reads \"Exp. Feb. 6, 1989\". He smells the pack.\n\nAPU\nJiminy Cricket! Wooh, expired ham.\n(He crosses the date out and puts it on the \"Bargain Table\")\nOh, this time I have gone to far. No, no one will fall for--\n\nHOMER\n(Walks into the store) Woohoo! Cheap meat! (picks it up) Ooh, this one's open.\n\nHe starts eating it. Later at home, Homer is on the couch,\nstill finishing it off. His stomach starts to growl.\nHOMER\nStomach...churning! (eats more) Bowels...clenching! Not much time... (falls off the couch) ...must...finish...\nHe finishes the ham. Cut to an ambulance rushing him to hospital.\nDR. HIBBERT\n(At hospital) Well sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting spoiled food,or, (chuckling) some sort of voodoo curse.\n\nPATTY\nHey, we've just been working the eyes.\n\nShe holds up a Homer doll with pins in the eyes.\nLater at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer confronts Apu.\nHOMER\nYour old meat made me sick!\n\nAPU\nOh, I'm so sorry. (pulls out a bucket from under the counter)\n\nPlease accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.\n\nHOMER\n(holds one up and sniffs it) This shrimp isn't frozen! And it smells funny!\n\nAPU\n(brings out another bucket) Okay, ten pounds.\n\nHOMER\nWoohoo!\nAn ambulance rushed Homer to hospital again.\n\nLater at home, a television program shows a dog in detective uniform, barking.\nWith each bark a word flies onto the screen.\nTogether, it reads \"Bite Back with Kent Brockman and his Channel 6 Consumer Watch Unit\".\nHomer and Lisa are watching this show;\nHomer is lying ill on the couch and Lisa sitting on the floor.\n\nTV VOICEOVER\nBrought to you by... (more barking)\nHOMER\nThat dog can sell anything.\n\nBROCKMAN\n(At news desk) Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home expos\u00e9, \"Geezers in Freezers\". It turns out the rest home was adequately heated; the footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term \"geezers\". Now, coming up next, the case of the cantankerous old geezer.\n\nHOMER\n(stomach growls again) Oh, rancid meat attack! Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?\n\nBROCKMAN\nIf you have a consumer complaint, just call this number--\n\nHOMER\nBoring!\n\nLISA\nDad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart.\n\nBROCKMAN\nAnd now a message from the Church of Latter-Day Saints.\n(the dog barks again)\nLISA\nDad, are you listening to me?\n\nHOMER\nShh! Lisa, the dog is barking.\n\nSometime later at Channel 6 Studios, Homer talks to Kent.\nBROCKMAN\nAll right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?\n\nHOMER\nNo way, man. No way, man!\nGet yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire!\n\nBROCKMAN\nAll right, all right, all right.\nWould you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?\n\nHOMER\nOh, that I'll wear.\n\nThe next day, a van labeled \"Ordinary Van\" is parked outside the Kwik-E-Mart. Homer and Kent are inside. Kent and another man hold up a large hat with an obviously visible camera inside.\nBROCKMAN\nWe've come up with a camera so tiny, it fits into this oversized novelty hat.\nThey put it on Homer's head. He struggles to stand upright under the weight.\nBROCKMAN\nNow, go get us some incriminating footage, and remember:\nyou have to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck damage.\n\nA man with his head bent sideways at right angles appears.\nMAN\nHe's not kiddin'.\n\nHomer enters the Kwik-E-Mart, unable to walk straight because of the hat. Apu looks confused as he slowly makes his way to the counter.\nAPU\nOoh?\n\nHOMER\nDon't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.\n\nAPU\nYour headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet?\n\nHOMER\nBee? Aah!\n\nHe throws the hat on the floor and screams, stomps on it and runs out of the store still screaming and into the van.\nBROCKMAN\nHomer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years!\nHe had one day left till retirement.\n\nThe camera still seems to be working. On the monitor in the van, the crew see Apu going about his business.\nAPU\nWell, time to replenish the hot dog roller. La, la, la...\n\nHe drops a hot dog, and it rolls right up to the camera. I\nt's covered with dirt, a dead fly, and a bandage. Apu picks it up.\nAPU\nAw look, it is encrusted with filth. (blows some of the dirt off)\nOh well, let's sell it anyway. (looks into the camera)\nNow this is just between me and you, smashed hat! (chuckles)\n\nBROCKMAN\nHot diggety-dog, we've got him, Mr. Simpson! Now let's...Mr. Simpson?\n\nThey see him on the monitor inside the Kwik-E-Mart.\nHOMER\nOne hot dog, please. (eats it)\n\nThe next day, the Simpsons family watch the \"Bite Back\" episode\nBROCKMAN\nApu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?\n\nAPU\n(nervously) No...I mean, yes...I mean...uh-oh...\n\nApu is also watching at the Kwik-E-Mart in front of some customers. He turns the TV off.\nAPU\nI think I come off very well.\n\nWOMAN\nMonster! Run, children.\n\nAs they run out, an inspector and two men in suits come in.\nINSPECTOR\nApu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart Corporation.\n\nAPU\nBut, sir, I was only following standard procedure.\n\nINSPECTOR\nAh, true. But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb.\n\nAPU\nUh huh, and if I can obtain for you these animals?\n\nINSPECTOR\nI'm sorry, Apu: I have no choice. You can no longer wear this name patch. (tears it off; Apu gasps) And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles. (tears off another patch) Now, turn in your pricing gun.\n\nApu takes it out of a shoulder holster and hands it in.\nINSPECTOR\nThe other one, too.\n\nApu takes it out if an ankle holster and gives it to the inspector.\n\nAPU\n(sighs) Fired...after all these years of loyal service.\nI don't want to live any more! (picks up a hot dog and is about to eat it)\n\nINSPECTOR\n(grabs him) Give me that wiener!\n\nAPU\nI don't want to live, sir!\n\nINSPECTOR\nGive me that wiener! (they struggle) No, Apu, it's not worth it!\n\nThat night, Apu stands on a bridge, depressed.\nAPU\nWhat do I do now? I have been drummed out of my profession.\nI'm a disgrace! Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.\n\nTwo homeless guys are underneath the bridge, tickling each other with feathers.\nHOBO\n(laughing) Who needs money when we got feathers?\n\nApu walks past a pet store.\nA sign in the window reads \"Today Only -- Laughing Monkeys.\"\nA bunch of monkeys all begin to laugh and point at him.\nApu then wanders down the Simpsons' street and stops in front of their house. A thunderstorm begins.\nAPU\nThis is all because of Homer Simpson!\n\nInside, Homer is on the couch watching TV and laughing. He watches a black stand-up comedian.\nHOMER\nOh, oh, stop!\n\nCOMEDIAN\nYo, check this out: black guys drive a car like this!\n(Leans back, as though one hand is on the wheel and his elbow is resting on the windowsill, and sings a tune)\nDo, do, chh. Do be do, do be do-be-do. (audience laughs)\nYeah, but white guys, see, they drive a car like this!\n(Leans forward forward with both hands on the wheel) Dee-da-dee, a-dee-da-dee...\nHOMER\n(laughing hard) It's true, it's true! We're so lame!\n\nAPU\n(outside the window) It is time to settle the score!\n\nHe knocks on the door and Homer opens it.\nApu, drenched in rain water, threateningly reaches his arms out for Homer. Homer steps back and screams.\nACT TWO\nHomer is still screaming.\nHOMER\nNo, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware. I was unaware! (sobs)\n\nAPU\nMr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village, this is the traditional pose of apology.\n\nHOMER\nOh.\n\nAPU\n(putting his arms down) You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing.\nMany have died needlessly. I have come to make amends, sir.\nAt first, I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized, it was I who wronged you.\nSo I have come to work off my debt - I am at your service.\n\nHOMER\nYou're selling what, now?\n\nAPU\nI am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.\n\nHOMER\nYou can't sell that! Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos. (slams door)\nAPU\n(to himself) He's got me there.\n\nThe next day, Marge and the kids see Apu raking leaves on the family's front lawn. Homer comes down the stairs.\nHOMER\nIs he still out there?\n\nMARGE\nYes, he's raking leaves.\n\nHOMER\nWhat? That's your job! If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping--\n\nMARGE\nIf he wants to make it up to you so badly I think you should let him.\n\nHOMER\nOkay, okay, I'll let him. But then I get a Chipwich, okay?\n\nLater, Apu serves the family dinner.\nAPU\nIt is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Ramatpur I was considered quite the gourmet.\n\nMARGE\nHmm, it certainly is exotic. (sees Lisa panting with a vacant stare)Ooh, Lisa, is that too spicy for you?\n\nLISA\nI can see through time!\n\nHOMER\n(wolfing it down) Stop being such babies.\nYou can't be afraid to try new things.\nFor instance, tonight I'm using a-- Apu, what do you call this thing again?\n\nAPU\nA napkin.\n\nHOMER\n(laughing) Outrageous!\n\nMeanwhile at the Kwik-E-Mart, the inspector and a woman are interviewing Barney.\nINSPECTOR\nAll right, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart family?\n\nBARNEY\nBecause I like people. And I need a place where I'll be out of the sun.\n\nWOMAN\nThank you.\n\nBarney burps and leaves.\nINSPECTOR\nHmm... he's head and shoulders above everyone else.\n\nWOMAN\nHold on, there's one more applicant.\n\nJames Woods walk into the room and sits down.\nINSPECTOR\nName?\n\nWOODS\nJames Woods, heh.\n\nWOMAN\nPrevious job experience?\n\nWOODS\nOoh, uh, let's see...True Believer, Salvador, Onion Field, The Hard Way.\n\nINSPECTOR\nWait, wait a minute. Those aren't convenience stores. That sounds more like the resume of a Hollywood movie star!\n\nWOODS\n(chuckles) Well, er...\n\nINSPECTOR & WOMAN\n(gasp) James Woods!\n\nWOMAN\nWhy would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?\n\nWOODS\nTo be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it.\nFor instance, True Believer?\nI actually worked in a law firm for two months.\nAnd then, the film Chaplin, I had a little cameo in that.\nI actually traveled in time, back to the twenties, where-- oh, heh, I've said too much.\n\nINSPECTOR\nWelcome aboard.\n\nThe next morning, Homer is taking a shower.\nHe steps out of the cubicle and reaches for his towel, but can't find it. Apu hands the towel to Homer.\nAPU\nGood morning, sir!\n\nHOMER\nAah!\n\nAPU\nRelax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. (looks down) What the--\n\nHomer has a lollipop stuck to his chest.\nHOMER\nUh... I like to keep a lollipop there.\n\nIn the kitchen, Apu stacks cans of corn in a pyramid.\nMARGE\nHmm... Apu, we normally store out cans in the cupboard.\n\nAPU\nOh they'll never move that way.\n\nBart and Lisa enter and take a can each.\nLISA\nMmm, corn. Haven't had that in a while.\n\nBART\nYeah, delicious corn.\n\nBART & LISA\nBye.\n\nThey leave. Marge looks in the fridge.\nMARGE\nOh, we're low on milk for Maggie.\nYou want to come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?\n\nApu accidentally knocks over the stack of cans in shock.\nAPU\nPlease, Mrs. Simpson, I...I cannot go there. That is the scene of my spiritual de-pantsing.\n\nMARGE\nHmm...well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart.\n\nThe Monstromart is a huge concrete block.\nThe store's motto reads \"Where Shopping Is A Baffling Ordeal\".\nInside, the products are oversized, the aisles are wide,\nand the shelving reaches to the ceiling. Marge picks up a huge box of nutmeg.\nMARGE\nOoh, that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.\n\nAPU\nOh, great selection at rock-bottom prices. But where is the love?\n\nAn announcement comes over the tannoy.\nTANNOY\nAttention, Monstromart shoppers. Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.\n\nCUSTOMERS\nAhh...\n\nBarney pushes a flatbed trolley with a large keg of Duff Beer on it.\nHe passes a display of pancake syrup bottles, shaped like people.\n\nBARNEY\n(approaching a bottle) Excuse me ma'am, where are the lampshades?\n(pushing the bottle on the 'shoulder') Ma'am? (he knocks the bottle over, spilling syrup)\nOh no. I've killed her! It's all happening again!!\n\nHe screams and runs into a display of cranberry juice bottles, causing a tidal wave to wash down the aisle that Marge and Apu are in.\nSHOP ASSISTANT\n(drowning) Help me! Help m-- (he goes under, then resurfaces) Mmm, it's cran-tastic!\n\nMarge and Apu arrive at the Express Lane, which is strictly \"1000 Items Or Less\".\nAPU\nLook, Mrs. Simpson, the express line is the fastest line not always.\nThat old man up front, he is staved for attention, he will talk the cashier's head off.\n\nThe old man is Grampa Simpson.\nGRAMPA\nAh, there's an interesting story behind this nickel.\nIn 1957 I remember it was. I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to three - medium brown.\n\nAPU\nLet's cut to... that line.\n\nMARGE\nBut that's the longest!\n\nAPU\nYes, but look: all pathetic single men. Only cash, no chit-chat.\n\nThey move through the line quickly. Marge sighs with satisfaction.\nAt the Kwik-E-Mart, James Woods serves Jimbo.\nWOODS\n75, 85, 90, and a dollar. Thank you, and come again.\n(Jimbo starts to leave) Hey wait a minute! Hey! Uh, could I just ask you a question? Did you, heh, did you believe that, I mean, the way I gave you the change, that I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy?\n\nJIMBO\nActually, I though it was a little laboured. You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man!\n\nWOODS\nYeah, like yeah, okay great! Okay, let's just try that again. Okay, come on.\n(Jimbo starts to leave)\nCome on, hey, hey hey hey! Hey!! Get over here!\n(Jimbo comes back to the counter)\nOkay, now you're you, I'm me.\n\nJIMBO\nI'm me?\n\nWOODS\n(grabs Jimbo) Hey, don't jerk me around, fella.\n\nBack at the Simpson home, the family eat dinner.\nHOMER\nPass the chutney.\n\nMARGE\nApu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart.\n\nLISA\nAnd he taught me how to play the Shenai. (plays a weird wind instrument)\nHOMER\n(shudders) Oh, that's even worse than the album Grampa released.\n\nBART\nAnd he taught me how to do this. (he wraps his legs around behind his head)\nI got out of school 'cause I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.\n\nAPU\nThank you all for the kind praise.\n\nHOMER\nWell, you deserve it.\nAll these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.\n\nInside Homer's body, cholesterol makes its way from his stomach to his brain, causing it to spark like electricity.\nHOMER\n(in a trance) Uh. Apu friend me good.\n\nLISA\nI think what my father's saying is, you're like a member of the family now.\n\nAPU\nI feel that way too. You see...\nWhether igloo hut or lean-to, or a geodesic dome,\nThere's no structure I have been to which I'd rather call my home.\n\nGRAMPA\n(Entering) Hello...Aah!\n\nApu take his cane and he falls down. Music starts and Apu sings.\nAPU\nWhen I first arrived, you were all such jerks,\nBut now I've come to looooooove your quirks.\nMaggie with her eyes so bright,\nMarge with hair by Frank Lloyd Wright,\nLisa can philosophise,\nBart's adept at spinning lies,\nHomer's a delightful fella,\nSorry 'bout the salmonella.\n\nHOMER\n(spoken) Heh heh, that's okay.\n\nAPU\nWho needs the Kwik-E-Mart?\nNow here's the tricky part.\nOh, won't you rhyme with me?\nWho needs the Kwik-E-Mart?\n\nMARGE\nTheir floors are stick-E-Mart.\n\nLISA\nThey made Dad sick-E-Mart.\n\nBART\nLet's hurl a brick-E-Mart!\n\nHOMER\nThe Kwik-E-Mart is real...

heart\nAnd being true to your friends to the end from the start\nJust what is wealth it's just how you view it\nIt's not having to wonder whether or not you might lose it\nIt can't be about material

These mansions are to be had either unfurnished, where, if you have credit with Messrs. Gillows or Bantings, you can get them splendidly montees and decorated entirely according to your own fancy; or they are to be let furnished, a less troublesome and complicated arrangement to most parties. It was so that Crawley and his wife preferred to hire their house.\n\nBefore Mr. Bowls came to preside over Miss Crawley's house and cellar in Park Lane, that lady had had for a butler a Mr. Raggles, who was born on the family estate of Queen's Crawley, and indeed was a younger son of a gardener there. By good conduct, a handsome person and calves, and a grave demeanour, Raggles rose from the knife-board to the footboard of the carriage; from the footboard to the butler's pantry. When he had been a certain number of years at the head of Miss Crawley's establishment, where he had had good wages, fat perquisites, and plenty of opportunities of saving, he announced that he was about to contract a matrimonial alliance with a late cook of Miss Crawley's, who had subsisted in an honourable manner by the exercise of a mangle, and the keeping of a small greengrocer's shop in the neighbourhood. The truth is, that the ceremony had been clandestinely performed some years back; although the news of Mr. Raggles' marriage was first brought to Miss Crawley by a little boy and girl of seven and eight years of age, whose continual presence in the kitchen had attracted the attention of Miss Briggs.\n\nMr. Raggles then retired and personally undertook the superintendence of the small shop and the greens. He added milk and cream, eggs and country-fed pork to his stores, contenting himself whilst other retired butlers were vending spirits in public houses, by dealing in the simplest country produce. And having a good connection amongst the butlers in the neighbourhood, and a snug back parlour where he and Mrs. Raggles received them, his milk, cream, and eggs got to be adopted by many of the fraternity, and his profits increased every year. Year after year he quietly and modestly amassed money, and when at length that snug and complete bachelor's residence at No. 201, Curzon Street, May Fair, lately the residence of the Honourable Frederick Deuceace, gone abroad, with its rich and appropriate furniture by the first makers, was brought to the hammer, who should go in and purchase the lease and furniture of the house but Charles Raggles? A part of the money he borrowed, it is true, and at rather a high interest, from a brother butler, but the chief part he paid down, and it was with no small pride that Mrs. Raggles found herself sleeping in a bed of carved mahogany, with silk curtains, with a prodigious cheval glass opposite to her, and a wardrobe which would contain her, and Raggles, and all the family.\n\nOf course, they did not intend to occupy permanently an apartment so splendid. It was in order to let the house again that Raggles purchased it. As soon as a tenant was found, he subsided into the greengrocer's shop once more; but a happy thing it was for him to walk out of that tenement and into Curzon Street, and there survey his house\u2014his own house\u2014with geraniums in the window and a carved bronze knocker. The footman occasionally lounging at the area railing, treated him with respect; the cook took her green stuff at his house and called him Mr. Landlord, and there was not one thing the tenants did, or one dish which they had for dinner, that Raggles might not know of, if he liked.\n\nHe was a good man; good and happy. The house brought him in so handsome a yearly income that he was determined to send his children to good schools, and accordingly, regardless of expense, Charles was sent to boarding at Dr. Swishtail's, Sugar-cane Lodge, and little Matilda to Miss Peckover's, Laurentinum House, Clapham.\n\nRaggles loved and adored the Crawley family as the author of all his prosperity in life. He had a silhouette of his mistress in his back shop, and a drawing of the Porter's Lodge at Queen's Crawley, done by that spinster herself in India ink\u2014and the only addition he made to the decorations of the Curzon Street House was a print of Queen's Crawley in Hampshire, the seat of Sir Walpole Crawley, Baronet, who was represented in a gilded car drawn by six white horses, and passing by a lake covered with swans, and barges containing ladies in hoops, and musicians with flags and penwigs. Indeed Raggles thought there was no such palace in all the world, and no such august family.\n\nAs luck would have it, Raggles' house in Curzon Street was to let when Rawdon and his wife returned to London. The Colonel knew it and its owner quite well; the latter's connection with the Crawley family had been kept up constantly, for Raggles helped Mr. Bowls whenever Miss Crawley received friends. And the old man not only let his house to the Colonel but officiated as his butler whenever he had company; Mrs. Raggles operating in the kitchen below and sending up dinners of which old Miss Crawley herself might have approved. This was the way, then, Crawley got his house for nothing; for though Raggles had to pay taxes and rates, and the interest of the mortgage to the brother butler; and the insurance of his life; and the charges for his children at school; and the value of the meat and drink which his own family\u2014and for a time that of Colonel Crawley too\u2014consumed; and though the poor wretch was utterly ruined by the transaction, his children being flung on the streets, and himself driven into the Fleet Prison: yet somebody must pay even for gentlemen who live for nothing a year\u2014and so it was this unlucky Raggles was made the representative of Colonel Crawley's defective capital.\n\nI wonder how many families are driven to roguery and to ruin by great practitioners in Crawlers way?\u2014how many great noblemen rob their petty tradesmen, condescend to swindle their poor retainers out of wretched little sums and cheat for a few shillings? When we read that a noble nobleman has left for the Continent, or that another noble nobleman has an execution in his house\u2014and that one or other owes six or seven millions, the defeat seems glorious even, and we respect the victim in the vastness of his ruin. But who pities a poor barber who can't get his money for powdering the footmen's heads; or a poor carpenter who has ruined himself by fixing up ornaments and pavilions for my lady's dejeuner; or the poor devil of a tailor whom the steward patronizes, and who has pledged all he is worth, and more, to get the liveries ready, which my lord has done him the honour to bespeak? When the great house tumbles down, these miserable wretches fall under it unnoticed: as they say in the old legends, before a man goes to the devil himself, he sends plenty of other souls thither.\n\nRawdon and his wife generously gave their patronage to all such of Miss Crawley's tradesmen and purveyors as chose to serve them. Some were willing enough, especially the poor ones. It was wonderful to see the pertinacity with which the washerwoman from Tooting brought the cart every Saturday, and her bills week after week. Mr. Raggles himself had to supply the greengroceries. The bill for servants' porter at the Fortune of War public house is a curiosity in the chronicles of beer. Every servant also was owed the greater part of his wages, and thus kept up perforce an interest in the house. Nobody in fact was paid. Not the blacksmith who opened the lock; nor the glazier who mended the pane; nor the jobber who let the carriage; nor the groom who drove it; nor the butcher who provided the leg of mutton; nor the coals which roasted it; nor the cook who basted it; nor the servants who ate it: and this I am given to understand is not unfrequently the way in which people live elegantly on nothing a year.\n\nIn a little town such things cannot be done without remark. We know there the quantity of milk our neighbour takes and espy the joint or the fowls which are going in for his dinner. So, probably, 200 and 202 in Curzon Street might know what was going on in the house between them, the servants communicating through the area-railings; but Crawley and his wife and his friends did not know 200 and 202. When you came to 201 there was a hearty welcome, a kind smile, a good dinner, and a jolly shake of the hand from the host and hostess there, just for all the world as if they had been undisputed masters of three or four thousand a year\u2014and so they were, not in money, but in produce and labour\u2014if they did not pay for the mutton, they had it: if they did not give bullion in exchange for their wine, how should we know? Never was better claret at any man's table than at honest Rawdon's; dinners more gay and neatly served. His drawing-rooms were the prettiest, little, modest salons conceivable: they were decorated with the greatest taste, and a thousand knick-knacks from Paris, by Rebecca: and when she sat at her piano trilling songs with a lightsome heart, the stranger voted himself in a little paradise of domestic comfort and agreed that, if the husband was rather stupid, the wife was charming, and the dinners the pleasantest in the world.\n\nRebecca's wit, cleverness, and flippancy made her speedily the vogue in London among a certain class. You saw demure chariots at her door, out of which stepped very great people. You beheld her carriage in the park, surrounded by dandies of note. The little box in the third tier of the opera was crowded with heads constantly changing; but it must be confessed that the ladies held aloof from her, and that their doors were shut to our little adventurer.\n\nWith regard to the world of female fashion and its customs, the present writer of course can only speak at second hand. A man can no more penetrate or under-stand those mysteries than he can know what the ladies talk about when they go upstairs after dinner. It is only by inquiry and perseverance that one sometimes gets hints of those secrets; and by a similar diligence every person who treads the Pall Mall pavement and frequents the clubs of this metropolis knows, either through his own experience or through some acquaintance with whom he plays at billiards or shares the joint, something about the genteel world of London, and how, as there are men (such as Rawdon Crawley, whose position we mentioned before) who cut a good figure to the eyes of the ignorant world and to the apprentices in the park, who behold them consorting with the most notorious dandies there, so there are ladies, who may be called men's women, being welcomed entirely by all the gentlemen and cut or slighted by all their wives. Mrs. Firebrace is of this sort; the lady with the beautiful fair ringlets whom you see every day in Hyde Park, surrounded by the greatest and most famous dandies of this empire. Mrs. Rockwood is another, whose parties are announced laboriously in the fashionable newspapers and with whom you see that all sorts of ambassadors and great noblemen dine; and many more might be mentioned had they to do with the history at present in hand. But while simple folks who are out of the world, or country people with a taste for the genteel, behold these ladies in their seeming glory in public places, or envy them from afar off, persons who are better instructed could inform them that these envied ladies have no more chance of establishing themselves in \"society,\" than the benighted squire's wife in Somersetshire who reads of their doings in the Morning Post. Men living about London are aware of these awful truths. You hear how pitilessly many ladies of seeming rank and wealth are excluded from this \"society.\" The frantic efforts which they make to enter this circle, the meannesses to which they submit, the insults which they undergo, are matters of wonder to those who take human or womankind for a study; and the pursuit of fashion under difficulties would be a fine theme for any very great person who had the wit, the leisure, and the knowledge of the English language necessary for the compiling of such a history.\n\nNow the few female acquaintances whom Mrs. Crawley had known abroad not only declined to visit her when she came to this side of the Channel, but cut her severely when they met in public places. It was curious to see how the great ladies forgot her, and no doubt not altogether a pleasant study to Rebecca. When Lady Bareacres met her in the waiting-room at the opera, she gathered her daughters about her as if they would be contaminated by a touch of Becky, and retreating a step or two, placed herself in front of them, and stared at her little enemy. To stare Becky out of countenance required a severer glance than even the frigid old Bareacres could shoot out of her dismal eyes. When Lady de la Mole, who had ridden a score of times by Becky's side at Brussels, met Mrs. Crawley's open carriage in Hyde Park, her Ladyship was quite blind, and could not in the least recognize her former friend. Even Mrs. Blenkinsop, the banker's wife, cut her at church. Becky went regularly to church now; it was edifying to see her enter there with Rawdon by her side, carrying a couple of large gilt prayer-books, and afterwards going through the ceremony with the gravest resignation.\nRawdon at first felt very acutely the slights which were passed upon his wife, and was inclined to be gloomy and savage. He talked of calling out the husbands or brothers of every one of the insolent women who did not pay a proper respect to his wife; and it was only by the strongest commands and entreaties on her part that he was brought into keeping a decent behaviour. \"You can't shoot me into society,\" she said good-naturedly. \"Remember, my dear, that I was but a governess, and you, you poor silly old man, have the worst reputation for debt, and dice, and all sorts of wickedness. We shall get quite as many friends as we want by and by, and in the meanwhile you must be a good boy and obey your schoolmistress in everything she tells you to do. When we heard that your aunt had left almost everything to Pitt and his wife, do you remember what a rage you were in? You would have told all Paris, if I had not made you keep your temper, and where would you have been now?\u2014in prison at Ste. Pelagie for debt, and not established in London in a handsome house, with every comfort about you\u2014you were in such a fury you were ready to murder your brother, you wicked Cain you, and what good would have come of remaining angry? All the rage in the world won't get us your aunt's money; and it is much better that we should be friends with your brother's family than enemies, as those foolish Butes are. When your father dies, Queen's Crawley will be a pleasant house for you and me to pass the winter in. If we are ruined, you can carve and take charge of the stable, and I can be a governess to Lady Jane's children. Ruined! fiddlede-dee! I will get you a good place before that; or Pitt and his little boy will die, and we will be Sir Rawdon and my lady. While there is life, there is hope, my dear, and I intend to make a man of you yet. Who sold your horses for you? Who paid your debts for you?\" Rawdon was obliged to confess that he owed all these benefits to his wife, and to trust himself to her guidance for the future.\n\nIndeed, when Miss Crawley quitted the world, and that money for which all her relatives had been fighting so eagerly was finally left to Pitt, Bute Crawley, who found that only five thousand pounds had been left to him instead of the twenty upon which he calculated, was in such a fury at his disappointment that he vented it in savage abuse upon his nephew; and the quarrel always rankling between them ended in an utter breach of intercourse. Rawdon Crawley's conduct, on the other hand, who got but a hundred pounds, was such as to astonish his brother and delight his sister-in-law, who was disposed to look kindly upon all the members of her husband's family. He wrote to his brother a very frank, manly, good-humoured letter from Paris. He was aware, he said, that by his own marriage he had forfeited his aunt's favour; and though he did not disguise his disappointment that she should have been so entirely relentless towards him, he was glad that the money was still kept in their branch of the family, and heartily congratulated his brother on his good fortune. He sent his affectionate remembrances to his sister, and hoped to have her good-will for Mrs. Rawdon; and the letter concluded with a postscript to Pitt in the latter lady's own handwriting. She, too, begged to join in her husband's congratulations. She should ever remember Mr. Crawley's kindness to her in early days when she was a friendless orphan, the instructress of his little sisters, in whose welfare she still took the tenderest interest. She wished him every happiness in his married life, and, asking his permission to offer her remembrances to Lady Jane (of whose goodness all the world informed her), she hoped that one day she might be allowed to present her little boy to his uncle and aunt, and begged to bespeak for him their good-will and protection.\n\nPitt Crawley received this communication very graciously\u2014more graciously than Miss Crawley had received some of Rebecca's previous compositions in Rawdon's handwriting; and as for Lady Jane, she was so charmed with the letter that she expected her husband would instantly divide his aunt's legacy into two equal portions and send off one-half to his brother at Paris.\n\nTo her Ladyship's surprise, however, Pitt declined to accommodate his brother with a cheque for thirty thousand pounds. But he made Rawdon a handsome offer of his hand whenever the latter should come to England and choose to take it; and, thanking Mrs. Crawley for her good opinion of himself and Lady Jane, he graciously pronounced his willingness to take any opportunity to serve her little boy.\n\nThus an almost reconciliation was brought about between the brothers. When Rebecca came to town Pitt and his wife were not in London. Many a time she drove by the old door in Park Lane to see whether they had taken possession of Miss Crawley's house there. But the new family did not make its appearance; it was only through Raggles that she heard of their movements\u2014how Miss Crawley's domestics had been dismissed with decent gratuities, and how Mr. Pitt had only once made his appearance in London, when he stopped for a few days at the house, did business with his lawyers there, and sold off all Miss Crawley's French novels to a bookseller out of Bond Street. Becky had reasons of her own which caused her to long for the arrival of her new relation. \"When Lady Jane comes,\" thought she, \"she shall be my sponsor in London society; and as for the women! bah! the women will ask me when they find the men want to see me.\"\n\nAn article as necessary to a lady in this position as her brougham or her bouquet is her companion. I have always admired the way in which the tender creatures, who cannot exist without sympathy, hire an exceedingly plain friend of their own sex from whom they are almost inseparable. The sight of that inevitable woman in her faded gown seated behind her dear friend in the opera-box, or occupying the back seat of the barouche, is always a wholesome and moral one to me, as jolly a reminder as that of the Death's-head which figured in the repasts of Egyptian bon-vivants, a strange sardonic memorial of Vanity Fair. What? even battered, brazen, beautiful, conscienceless, heartless, Mrs. Firebrace, whose father died of her shame: even lovely, daring Mrs. Mantrap, who will ride at any fence which any man in England will take, and who drives her greys in the park, while her mother keeps a huckster's stall in Bath still\u2014even those who are so bold, one might fancy they could face anything dare not face the world without a female friend. They must have somebody to cling to, the affectionate creatures! And you will hardly see them in any public place without a shabby companion in a dyed silk, sitting somewhere in the shade close behind them.\n\n\"Rawdon,\" said Becky, very late one night, as a party of gentlemen were seated round her crackling drawing-room fire (for the men came to her house to finish the night; and she had ice and coffee for them, the best in London): \"I must have a sheep-dog.\"\n\n\"A what?\" said Rawdon, looking up from an ecarte table.\n\n\"A sheep-dog!\" said young Lord Southdown. \"My dear Mrs. Crawley, what a fancy! Why not have a Danish dog? I know of one as big as a camel-leopard, by Jove. It would almost pull your brougham. Or a Persian greyhound, eh? (I propose, if you please); or a little pug that would go into one of Lord Steyne's snuff-boxes? There's a man at Bayswater got one with such a nose that you might\u2014I mark the king and play\u2014that you might hang your hat on it.\"\n\n\"I mark the trick,\" Rawdon gravely said. He attended to his game commonly and didn't much meddle with the conversation, except when it was about horses and betting.\n\n\"What CAN you want with a shepherd's dog?\" the lively little Southdown continued.\n\n\"I mean a MORAL shepherd's dog,\" said Becky, laughing and looking up at Lord Steyne.\n\n\"What the devil's that?\" said his Lordship.\n\"A dog to keep the wolves off me,\" Rebecca continued. \"A companion.\"\n\n\"Dear little innocent lamb, you want one,\" said the marquis; and his jaw thrust out, and he began to grin hideously, his little eyes leering towards Rebecca.\n\nThe great Lord of Steyne was standing by the fire sipping coffee. The fire crackled and blazed pleasantly There was a score of candles sparkling round the mantel piece, in all sorts of quaint sconces, of gilt and bronze and porcelain. They lighted up Rebecca's figure to admiration, as she sat on a sofa covered with a pattern of gaudy flowers. She was in a pink dress that looked as fresh as a rose; her dazzling white arms and shoulders were half-covered with a thin hazy scarf through which they sparkled; her hair hung in curls round her neck; one of her little feet peeped out from the fresh crisp folds of the silk: the prettiest little foot in the prettiest little sandal in the finest silk stocking in the world.\n\nThe candles lighted up Lord Steyne's shining bald head, which was fringed with red hair. He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little twinkling bloodshot eyes, surrounded by a thousand wrinkles. His jaw was underhung, and when he laughed, two white buck-teeth protruded themselves and glistened savagely in the midst of the grin. He had been dining with royal personages, and wore his garter and ribbon. A short man was his Lordship, broad-chested and bow-legged, but proud of the fineness of his foot and ankle, and always caressing his garter-knee.\n\n\"And so the shepherd is not enough,\" said he, \"to defend his lambkin?\"\n\n\"The shepherd is too fond of playing at cards and going to his clubs,\" answered Becky, laughing.\n\n\"'Gad, what a debauched Corydon!\" said my lord\u2014\"what a mouth for a pipe!\"\n\n\"I take your three to two,\" here said Rawdon, at the card-table.\n\n\"Hark at Meliboeus,\" snarled the noble marquis; \"he's pastorally occupied too: he's shearing a Southdown. What an innocent mutton, hey? Damme, what a snowy fleece!\"\n\nRebecca's eyes shot out gleams of scornful humour. \"My lord,\" she said, \"you are a knight of the Order.\" He had the collar round his neck, indeed\u2014a gift of the restored princes of Spain.\n\nLord Steyne in early life had been notorious for his daring and his success at play. He had sat up two days and two nights with Mr. Fox at hazard. He had won money of the most august personages of the realm: he had won his marquisate, it was said, at the gaming-table; but he did not like an allusion to those bygone fredaines. Rebecca saw the scowl gathering over his heavy brow.\n\nShe rose up from her sofa and went and took his coffee cup out of his hand with a little curtsey. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I must get a watchdog. But he won't bark at YOU.\" And, going into the other drawing-room, she sat down to the piano and began to sing little French songs in such a charming, thrilling voice that the mollified nobleman speedily followed her into that chamber, and might be seen nodding his head and bowing time over her.\n\nRawdon and his friend meanwhile played ecarte until they had enough. The Colonel won; but, say that he won ever so much and often, nights like these, which occurred many times in the week\u2014his wife having all the talk and all the admiration, and he sitting silent without the circle, not comprehending a word of the jokes, the allusions, the mystical language within\u2014must have been rather wearisome to the ex-dragoon.\n\"How is Mrs. Crawley's husband?\" Lord Steyne used to say to him by way of a good day when they met; and indeed that was now his avocation in life. He was Colonel Crawley no more. He was Mrs. Crawley's husband.\n\nAbout the little Rawdon, if nothing has been said all this while, it is because he is hidden upstairs in a garret somewhere, or has crawled below into the kitchen for companionship. His mother scarcely ever took notice of him. He passed the days with his French bonne as long as that domestic remained in Mr. Crawley's family, and when the Frenchwoman went away, the little fellow, howling in the loneliness of the night, had compassion taken on him by a housemaid, who took him out of his solitary nursery into her bed in the garret hard by and comforted him.\n\nRebecca, my Lord Steyne, and one or two more were in the drawing-room taking tea after the opera, when this shouting was heard overhead. \"It's my cherub crying for his nurse,\" she said. She did not offer to move to go and see the child. \"Don't agitate your feelings by going to look for him,\" said Lord Steyne sardonically. \"Bah!\" replied the other, with a sort of blush, \"he'll cry himself to sleep\"; and they fell to talking about the opera.\n\nRawdon had stolen off though, to look after his son and heir; and came back to the company when he found that honest Dolly was consoling the child. The Colonel's dressing-room was in those upper regions. He used to see the boy there in private. They had interviews together every morning when he shaved; Rawdon minor sitting on a box by his father's side and watching the operation with never-ceasing pleasure. He and the sire were great friends. The father would bring him sweetmeats from the dessert and hide them in a certain old epaulet box, where the child went to seek them, and laughed with joy on discovering the treasure; laughed, but not too loud: for mamma was below asleep and must not be disturbed. She did not go to rest till very late and seldom rose till after noon.\n\nRawdon bought the boy plenty of picture-books and crammed his nursery with toys. Its walls were covered with pictures pasted up by the father's own hand and purchased by him for ready money. When he was off duty with Mrs. Rawdon in the park, he would sit up here, passing hours with the boy; who rode on his chest, who pulled his great mustachios as if they were driving-reins, and spent days with him in indefatigable gambols. The room was a low room, and once, when the child was not five years old, his father, who was tossing him wildly up in his arms, hit the poor little chap's skull so violently against the ceiling that he almost dropped the child, so terrified was he at the disaster.\n\nRawdon minor had made up his face for a tremendous howl\u2014the severity of the blow indeed authorized that indulgence; but just as he was going to begin, the father interposed.\n\n\"For God's sake, Rawdy, don't wake Mamma,\" he cried. And the child, looking in a very hard and piteous way at his father, bit his lips, clenched his hands, and didn't cry a bit. Rawdon told that story at the clubs, at the mess, to everybody in town. \"By Gad, sir,\" he explained to the public in general, \"what a good plucked one that boy of mine is\u2014what a trump he is! I half-sent his head through the ceiling, by Gad, and he wouldn't cry for fear of disturbing his mother.\"\n\nSometimes\u2014once or twice in a week\u2014that lady visited the upper regions in which the child lived. She came like a vivified figure out of the Magasin des Modes\u2014blandly smiling in the most beautiful new clothes and little gloves and boots. Wonderful scarfs, laces, and jewels glittered about her. She had always a new bonnet on, and flowers bloomed perpetually in it, or else magnificent curling ostrich feathers, soft and snowy as camellias. She nodded twice or thrice patronizingly to the little boy, who looked up from his dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was painting. When she left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical fragrance, lingered about the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his eyes, superior to his father\u2014to all the world: to be worshipped and admired at a distance. To drive with that lady in the carriage was an awful rite: he sat up in the back seat and did not dare to speak: he gazed with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed Princess opposite to him. Gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up and smiled and talked with her. How her eyes beamed upon all of them! Her hand used to quiver and wave gracefully as they passed. When he went out with her he had his new red dress on. His old brown holland was good enough when he stayed at home. Sometimes, when she was away, and Dolly his maid was making his bed, he came into his mother's room. It was as the abode of a fairy to him\u2014a mystic chamber of splendour and delights. There in the wardrobe hung those wonderful robes\u2014pink and blue and many-tinted. There was the jewel-case, silver-clasped, and the wondrous bronze hand on the dressing-table, glistening all over with a hundred rings. There was the cheval-glass, that miracle of art, in which he could just see his own wondering head and the reflection of Dolly (queerly distorted, and as if up in the ceiling), plumping and patting the pillows of the bed. Oh, thou poor lonely little benighted boy! Mother is the name for God in the lips and hearts of little children; and here was one who was worshipping a stone!\n\nNow Rawdon Crawley, rascal as the Colonel was, had certain manly tendencies of affection in his heart and could love a child and a woman still. For Rawdon minor he had a great secret tenderness then, which did not escape Rebecca, though she did not talk about it to her husband. It did not annoy her: she was too good-natured. It only increased her scorn for him. He felt somehow ashamed of this paternal softness and hid it from his wife\u2014only indulging in it when alone with the boy.\n\nHe used to take him out of mornings when they would go to the stables together and to the park. Little Lord Southdown, the best-natured of men, who would make you a present of the hat from his head, and whose main occupation in life was to buy knick-knacks that he might give them away afterwards, bought the little chap a pony not much bigger than a large rat, the donor said, and on this little black Shetland pygmy young Rawdon's great father was pleased to mount the boy, and to walk by his side in the park. It pleased him to see his old quarters, and his old fellow-guardsmen at Knightsbridge: he had begun to think of his bachelorhood with something like regret. The old troopers were glad to recognize their ancient officer and dandle the little colonel. Colonel Crawley found dining at mess and with his brother-officers very pleasant. \"Hang it, I ain't clever enough for her\u2014I know it. She won't miss me,\" he used to say: and he was right, his wife did not miss him.\n\nRebecca was fond of her husband. She was always perfectly good-humoured and kind to him. She did not even show her scorn much for him; perhaps she liked him the better for being a fool. He was her upper servant and maitre d'hotel. He went on her errands; obeyed her orders without question; drove in the carriage in the ring with her without repining; took her to the opera-box, solaced himself at his club during the performance, and came punctually back to fetch her when due. He would have liked her to be a little fonder of the boy, but even to that he reconciled himself. \"Hang it, you know she's so clever,\" he said, \"and I'm not literary and that, you know.\" For, as we have said before, it requires no great wisdom to be able to win at cards and billiards, and Rawdon made no pretensions to any other sort of skill.\n\nWhen the companion came, his domestic duties became very light. His wife encouraged him to dine abroad: she would let him off duty at the opera. \"Don't stay and stupefy yourself at home to-night, my dear,\" she would say. \"Some men are coming who will only bore you. I would not ask them, but you know it's for your good, and now I have a sheep-dog, I need not be afraid to be alone.\"\n\n\"A sheep-dog\u2014a companion! Becky Sharp with a companion! Isn't it good fun?\" thought Mrs. Crawley to herself. The notion tickled hugely her sense of humour.\n\nOne Sunday morning, as Rawdon Crawley, his little son, and the pony were taking their accustomed walk in the park, they passed by an old acquaintance of the Colonel's, Corporal Clink, of the regiment, who was in conversation with a friend, an old gentleman, who held a boy in his arms about the age of little Rawdon. This other youngster had seized hold of the Waterloo medal which the Corporal wore, and was examining it with delight.\n\n\"Good morning, your Honour,\" said Clink, in reply to the \"How do, Clink?\" of the Colonel. \"This ere young gentleman is about the little Colonel's age, sir,\" continued the corporal.\n\n\"His father was a Waterloo man, too,\" said the old gentleman, who carried the boy. \"Wasn't he, Georgy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Georgy. He and the little chap on the pony were looking at each other with all their might\u2014solemnly scanning each other as children do.\n\n\"In a line regiment,\" Clink said with a patronizing air.\n\n\"He was a Captain in the \u2014th regiment,\" said the old gentleman rather pompously. \"Captain George Osborne, sir\u2014perhaps you knew him. He died the death of a hero, sir, fighting against the Corsican tyrant.\" Colonel Crawley blushed quite red. \"I knew him very well, sir,\" he said, \"and his wife, his dear little wife, sir\u2014how is she?\"\n\n\"She is my daughter, sir,\" said the old gentleman, putting down the boy and taking out a card with great solemnity, which he handed to the Colonel. On it written\u2014\n\n\"Mr. Sedley, Sole Agent for the Black Diamond and Anti-Cinder Coal Association, Bunker's Wharf, Thames Street, and Anna-Maria Cottages, Fulham Road West.\"\n\nLittle Georgy went up and looked at the Shetland pony.\n\n\"Should you like to have a ride?\" said Rawdon minor from the saddle.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Georgy. The Colonel, who had been looking at him with some interest, took up the child and put him on the pony behind Rawdon minor.\n\n\"Take hold of him, Georgy,\" he said\u2014\"take my little boy round the waist\u2014his name is Rawdon.\" And both the children began to laugh.\n\n\"You won't see a prettier pair I think, THIS summer's day, sir,\" said the good-natured Corporal; and the Colonel, the Corporal, and old Mr. Sedley with his umbrella, walked by the side of the children.", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 32386, "name": "William Makepeace Thackeray", "imageURL": "https://images.genius.com/487db6359717d142ffd899b4d102b0a4.465x582x1.jpg"}, "fullTitle": "The Subject Continued by William Makepeace Thackeray", "releaseDateComponents": {"year": 1848, "month": 1, "day": null}}, {"songID": 7681820, "lyrics": "1 ContributorDEADROSE Lyrics(Hook)\nFind me outside on a moonlit night\n\nNo sleep nocturnal a vampire\n\nBroke me Imma cut out both my eyes\n\nBury me with a dead rose\nGirl don\u2019t cry\n\nWith a dead rose\n\nDon\u2019t cry\n\nPromise that you\u2019ll be alright\n\n3 AM on a moonlit night\n\nCall the priest to read my last rites\n\n\n(Verse)\nSpend my time on shit so fake\n\nI need more, just something real\nYou might also likeLost my mind or did you take it?\n\nSince you left I just can\u2019t feel\n\nI skipped class until I dropped out\n\nAunty called she mad as fuck\n\nTake my life I want it back now\n\nI write songs and I get drunk\n\nSeasons change and people leav\u0435\n\nGive a fuck about you or if you\u2019re breathin\u2019\n\nI\u2019v\u0435 been down and I might bleed\n\nAin\u2019t quite there yet, soon you\u2019ll see it\n\nDiamond piercings and tattoos\n\nSick of livin\u2019 just to survive\n\nDoin\u2019 drugs in club bathrooms\nBetter dead than tryna just get by\n\n\n(Hook x2)\nFind me outside on a moonlit night\n\nNo sleep nocturnal a vampire\n\nBroke me Imma cut out both my eyes\n\nBury me with a dead rose\nGirl don\u2019t cry\n\nWith a dead rose\n\nDon\u2019t cry\n\nPromise that you\u2019ll be alright\n\n3 AM on a moonlit night\n\nCall the priest to read my last rites", "featuredArtists": [], "primaryArtist": {"id": 1809735, "name": "Julixn", "imageURL": "https://images.genius.com/aaede363a5ec99d4d53538e4cbc9f14b.1000x1000x1.jpg"}, "fullTitle": "DEADROSE by Julixn", "releaseDateComponents": {"year": 2022, "month": 2, "day": 8}}, {"songID": 1807316, "lyrics": "\n[Intro: Ghostface Killah]\nYeah, yo\n\n[Verse 1: Amy]\nMeet you downstairs, in the bar and hurt\nYour rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt\nYou say \"What did you do with him today?\"\nAnd sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray\n'Cause you're my fella, my guy\nHand me your Stella and fly\nBy the time I'm out the door\nYou tear men down like Roger Moore\n\n[Chorus: Amy]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you, I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\n[Verse 2: Amy]\nUpstairs in bed with my ex-boy\nHe's in the place but I can't get joy\nThinking on you in the final throes\nThis is when my buzzer goes\nRun out to meet you, chips and pitta\nYou say, \"When we married\"\n'cause you're not bitter\n\"There'll be none of him no more\"\nI cried for you on the kitchen floor\n\n[Chorus: Amy]\nI cheated myself\nLike I knew I would\nI told you I was trouble\nYou know that I'm no good\n\n[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]\nYo, I knew you was trouble when I first laid eyes on you\nTemperature's so hot, the heat just rise with you\nLet me ride with you, talk about your mistakes\nYou cheated yourself but these are the breaks\nAnd it never be the same again, cause of old boy\nBut oh boy, together we make so much joy\nIn the sands and oh, what a web we weave\nBut you played me, so I had to roll up my sleeves and\nHunt you down, holding the next man's stacks\nNow you sorry, tryin' bring that old thing back and\nAct like we can rekindle that flame\nIt's a shame, how you can't get me off the brain\nHear that lame?

and you know I\u2019m reversing\nAll this fire that I\u2019m spitting, boy you know that I\u2019m burning\nAnd you know I'm on the plane and my gang is about boarding\nAnd you know I\u2019m going to accomplish everything it\u2019s rewarding\nAnd you know I\u2019m in the car and you know I am skirting\nLittle general you know that I\u2019m shot calling, I\u2019m balling\nI stack it, spend it, I flip it, I whip it up in the kitchen\nCause I\u2019m flipping, I\u2019m whipping, but you know I gotta get\nCause you know I gotta stack it\nAnd I\u2019m balling, but you know that I show\nAnd you

nigga to wake up\nIt's just hard to just keep goin'\nIt's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here\nI would do anything, man, to bring you back\nI'd give all this shit up, this shit don't mean nothing\nI saw your son today, he look just like you\nYou was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest\nI miss you, B.I.G. \nCan't wait 'til that day when I see your face again\nI can't wait 'til that day when I see your face again\n\n[Intro: Puff Daddy]\nYeah, this right here (Tell me why)\nGoes out to everyone that has lost someone\nThat they truly loved (C'mon, check it out)\n\n[Verse 1: Puff Daddy]\nIt seems like yesterday we used to rock the show\nI laced the track, you locked the flow\nSo far from hangin' on the block for dough\nNotorious, they got to know that\nLife ain't always what it seem to be\nWords can't express what you mean to me\nEven though you're gone, we still a team\nThrough your family, I'll fulfill your dream (That's right)\nIn the future, can't wait to see\nIf you open up the gates for me\nReminisce some time, the night they took my friend\nTry to black it out, but it plays again\nWhen it's real, feelings hard to conceal\nCan't imagine all the pain I feel\nGive anythin' to hear half your breath (Half your breath)\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n\n[Chorus: Faith Evans & Puff Daddy]\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you\nThinkin' of the day\nWhen you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you (I miss you, B.I.G.)\n\n[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]\nIt's kinda hard with you not around (Yeah)\nKnow you in Heaven, smilin' down (Ha)\nWatchin' us while we pray for you\nEvery day we pray for you\n'Til the day we meet again\nIn my heart is where I'll keep you, friend\nMemories give me the strength I need to proceed\nStrength I need to believe\nMy thoughts, B.I.G., I just can't define (Can't define)\nWish I could turn back the hands of time\nUs in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks\nYou and me takin' flicks\nMakin' hits, stages they receive you on\nStill can't believe you're gone (Can't believe you're gone)\nGive anything to hear half your breath (Half your breath)\nI know you still livin' your life after death\n[Chorus: Faith Evans]\nEvery step I take\nEvery move I make (I miss you)\nEvery single day, every time I pray\nI'll be missin' you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nThinkin' of the day\nWhen you went away\nWhat a life to take, what a bond to break\nI'll be missin' you (Somebody tell me why)\n\n[Interlude: Faith Evans]\nOne glad morning\nWhen this life is over\nI know I'll see your face\n\n[Outro: 112, Puff Daddy & Faith Evans]\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day\nEvery night I pray, every step I take (Every day that passes is a day that I get closer)\nEvery move I make, every single day (To seeing you again)\nEvery night I pray, every step I take (We miss you, B.I.G., and we won't stop 'cause we can't stop)\nEvery move I make, every single day (That's right)\nEvery night I pray, every step I take\nEvery move I make, every single day (We miss you, B.I.G)\nEvery step I

muddying the glass / But, God, I love the sound of heaven\"\nAnd um, yeah, this is a song, another song that was written in that batch, along with \"Borderline\"\nAnd along with the next two, well, the next one, at least\nAnd uh, it's called \"Vega\"\nThe Vega is, um, the brightest star in the Lyra constellation\nWhich, uh, that I find quite cool\nI kind of like, it's, I found it really weird writing to Aaron's music 'cause\nWhat, what happens with, Aaron basically sends a fully formed song, \u0435ssentially, and you write over it\nAnd usually I would b\u0435 in the studio and I would get, I would pick up a guitar and I'd go, \"Right, what do we write about tonight? We do 'bad habits lead to late nights' okay, is that a good line, is it 'bad habits lead to late nights' is this-\"\nAnd you kind of go back and forth and you bounce ideas, and that's the collaborative process that I've usually done\nWhereas this collaborative process is Aaron going like, \"Just write what you feel\"\nAnd I found words pouring out and some of them I was like, \"What does that even mean?

heel m'n visie grijs\nHoe lang gaat het nog duren voordat jij van ons verdwijnt?\nIk ben geen prater van mezelf, zweer die shit maakte me leip\nIk had struggles op het plein met de jongens van groep 5\nTerwijl ik naar ze opkeek, ik wou kunnen ballie zoals zij\nSucces was een obsessie, werd geen Crisje en geen Messi\nWel een rapper, shit was leuk totdat ik raakte in depressie\nVan een showtje naar een sessie, ik bleef rennen zonder rust\nSoms voelt het of ik op de oceaan drijf, zoekend naar de kust\nMoet God bedanken voor wat ik heb, want die shit is mij gelukt\nProbeer me sterk te houden, ik wil niet bezwijken onder druk\nMaar shit is heavy, iedereen heeft een mening en ik zeg niets\nMaar ik vraag me wel af, \"Waarom altijd ik?\" als Balotelli\nOp de snellie heel de dag, ik wil niet kijken naar m'n tellie\nWant zij praten tegen mij, maar hebben die mensen me wel lief?\nOf skiemen ze m'n money en m'n fame?\nJe mag het hebben, ben toch veel liever net zoals iedereen\nIk weet dat ze mij veel liever zien liggen onder een steen\nEn daarom invest ik in guns, als ik wegga neem ik je mee, ben een probleem\nIk weet dat ze me zien als een bedreiging\nIk weet ook niet waarom, doe gewoon jouw ding, dan doe ik mijn ding\nSoms kijk ik naar de hype en kom ik stiekem in verleiding\nMaar ik blijf altijd mezelf, ik ga niet over die scheiding\nBen een real one, ongeacht wat zij zeggen\nWant sinds de fame wil iedereen wat over mij zeggen\nSoms wil ik stoppen, maar m'n moeder zegt me, \"Blijf rappen\"\nWat er terecht komt van de kid dat mag de tijd zeggen\n\n[Outro]\nOp een gegeven moment

and cinnamon sweet\nAnd the rum is for all your good vices\nHaul the sheet in as we ride on the wind\nThat our forefathers harnessed before us\nHear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings\nIt's a son of a gun of a chorus\nWhere it all ends I can't fathom my friends\nIf I knew I might toss out my anchor\nSo I cruise along always searchin' for songs\nNot a lawyer a thief or a banker\nBut a son

Hard was the fight betwixt them; but Helgi goes through the folk of those brothers unto their banner, and there slays these sons of Hunding, Alf and Eyolf, Herward and Hagbard, and wins there a great victory.\n\nNow as Helgi fared from the fight he met many women right fair and worthy to look on, who rode in exceeding noble array; but one far excelled them all; then Helgi asked them the name of that their lady and queen, and she named herself Sigrun, and said she was daughter of King Hogni.\n\nThen said Helgi, \"Fare home with us: good welcome shall ye have!\"\n\nThen said the king's daughter, \"Other work lies before us than to drink with thee.\"\n\n\"Yea, and what work, king's daughter?\" said Helgi.\n\nShe answers, \"King Hogni has promised me to Hodbrod, the son of King Granmar, but I have vowed a vow that I will have him to my husband no more than if he were a crow's son and not a king's; and yet will the thing come to pass, but and if thou standest in the way thereof and goest against him with an army, and takest me away withal; for verily with no king would I rather bide on bolster than with thee.\"\n\n\"Be of good cheer, king's daughter,\" says he, \"for certes he and I shall try the matter, or ever thou be given to him; yea, we shall behold which may prevail against the other; and hereto I pledge my life.\"\n\nThereafter, Helgi sent men with money in their hand to summon his folk to him, and all his power is called together to Red-Berg: and there Helgi abode till such time as a great company came to him from Hedinsey; and therewithal came mighty power from Norvi Sound aboard great and fair ships. Then King Helgi called to him the captain of his ships, who was hight Leif, and asked him if he had told over the tale of his army.\n\n\"A thing not easy to tell, lord,\" says he, \"on the ships that came out of Norvi Sound are twelve thousand men, and otherwhere are half as many again.\"\n\nThen bade King Helgi turn into the firth, called Varin's firth, and they did so: but now there fell on them so fierce a storm and so huge a sea, that the beat of the waves on board and bow was to hearken to like as the clashing together of high hills broken.\n\nBut Helgi bade men fear naught, nor take in any sail, but rather hoist every rag higher than heretofore; but little did they miss of foundering or ever they made land; then came Sigrun, daughter of King Hogni, down on to the beach with a great army, and turned them away thence to a good haven called Gnipalund; but the landsmen see what has befallen and come down to the sea-shore. The brother of King Hodbrod, lord of a land called Swarin's Cairn, cried out to them, and asked them who was captain over that mighty army. Then up stands Sinfjotli, with a helm on his head, bright shining as glass, and a byrny as white as snow; a spear in his hand, and thereon a banner of renown, and a gold- rimmed shield hanging before him; and well he knew with what words to speak to kings --\n\n\"Go thou and say, when thou hast made an end of feeding thy swine and thy dogs, and when thou beholdest thy wife again, that here are come the Volsungs, and in this company may King Helgi be found, if Hodbrod be fain of finding him, for his game and his joy it is to fight and win fame, while thou art kissing the handmaids by the fire-side.\"\nThen answered Granmar, \"In nowise knowest thou how to speak seemly things, and to tell of matters remembered from of old, whereas thou layest lies on chiefs and lords; most like it is that thou must have long been nourished with wolf-meat abroad in the wild-woods, and has slain thy brethren; and a marvel it is to behold that thou darest to join thyself to the company of good men and true, thou, who hast sucked the blood of many a cold corpse.\"\n\nSinfjotli answered, \"Dim belike is grown thy memory now, of how thou wert a witch-wife on Varinsey, and wouldst fain have a man to thee, and chose me to that same office of all the world; and how thereafter thou wert a Valkyria in Asgarth, and it well- nigh came to this, that for thy sweet sake should all men fight; and nine wolf whelps I begat on thy body in Lowness, and was the father to them all.\"\n\nGranmar answers, \"Great skill of lying hast thou; yet belike the father of naught at all mayst thou be, since thou wert gelded by the giant's daughters of Thrasness; and lo thou art the stepson of King Siggeir, and were wont to lie abroad in wilds and woods with the kin of wolves; and unlucky was the hand wherewith thou slewest thy brethren making for thyself an exceeding evil name.\"\n\nSaid Sinfjotli, \"Mindest thou not then, when thou were stallion Grani's mare, and how I rode thee an amble on Bravoli, and that afterwards thou wert giant Golnir's goat herd?\"\n\nGranmar says, \"Rather would I feed fowls with the flesh of thee than wrangle any longer with thee.\"\n\nThen spake King Helgi, \"Better were it for ye, and a more manly deed, to fight, rather than to speak such things as it is a shame even to hearken to; Granmar's sons are no friends of me and of mine, yet are they hardy men none the less.\"\n\nSo Granmar rode away to meet King Hodbrod, at a stead called Sunfells, and the horses of the twain were named Sveipud and Sveggjud. The brothers met in the castle-porch, and Granmar told Hodbrod of the war-news. King Hodbrod was clad in a byrny, and had his helm on his head; he asked --\n\n\"What men are anigh, why look ye so wrathful?\"\n\nGranmar says, \"Here are come the Volsungs, and twelve thousand men of them are afloat off the coast, and seven thousand are at the island called Sok, but at the stead called Grindur is the greatest company of all, and now I deem withal that Helgi and his fellowship have good will to give battle.\"\n\nThen said the king, \"Let us send a message through all our realm, and go against them, neither let any who is fain of fight sit idle at home; let us send word to the sons of Ring, and to King Hogni, and to Alf the Old, for they are mighty warriors.\"\n\nSo the hosts met at Wolfstone, and fierce fight befell there; Helgi rushed forth through the host of his foes, and many a man fell there; at last folk saw a great company of shield-maidens, like burning flames to look on, and there was come Sigrun, the king's daughter.
